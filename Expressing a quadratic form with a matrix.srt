00:00:00,702 --> 00:00:01,535
- [Voiceover] Hey guys.

2
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:02,683
There's one more thing
I need to talk about

3
00:00:02,683 --> 00:00:05,179
before I can describe the vectorized form

4
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:08,240
for the quadratic approximation
of multivariable functions

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,848
which is a mouthful to say

6
00:00:09,848 --> 00:00:11,301
so let's say you have
some kind of expression

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,046
that looks like a times x squared

8
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:15,633
and I'm thinking x is a variable

9
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,700
times b times xy,

10
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,129
y is another variable,

11
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:21,214
plus c times y squared

12
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:23,298
and I'm thinking of a, b
and c as being constants

13
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:25,433
and x and y as being variables.

14
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:28,002
Now, this kind of
expression has a fancy name.

15
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,687
It's called a quadratic form.

16
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:31,520
Quadratic

17
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:33,687
form.

18
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:34,520
And that always threw me off.

19
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,919
I always kind of was like, what,

20
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,034
what does form mean?

21
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:38,508
I know what a quadratic expression is

22
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:40,552
and quadratic typically
means something is squared

23
00:00:40,552 --> 00:00:41,452
or you have two variables

24
00:00:41,452 --> 00:00:43,071
but why do they call it a form?

25
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:45,584
And basically it just means
that the only things in here

26
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:46,564
are quadratic.

27
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:48,401
It's not the case that you have an x term

28
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:50,770
sitting on its own or a constant out here

29
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,896
like two when you're adding
all of those together

30
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:55,676
instead it's just you have
purely quadratic terms

31
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:57,390
but of course, mathematicians
don't want to call it

32
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,023
just a purely quadratic expression

33
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:00,738
instead they have to give
a fancy name to things

34
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:03,475
so that it seems more
intimidating than it needs to be

35
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:05,191
but anyways, so we have a quadratic form

36
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,132
and the question is

37
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,316
how can we express this
in a vectorized sense?

38
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:11,240
And for analogy, let's
think about linear terms

39
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,644
where let's say you have a times x

40
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:15,451
plus b times y

41
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:16,799
and I'll throw another variable in there,

42
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,288
another constant times another variable z.

43
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,434
If you see something like this

44
00:01:20,434 --> 00:01:23,456
where every variable is just
being multiplied by a constant

45
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,622
and then you add terms
like that to each other,

46
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:27,995
we can express this nicely with vectors

47
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:30,940
where you pile all of the
constants into their own vector,

48
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,316
a vector containing a, b and c

49
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:34,992
and you imagine the dot product

50
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:37,309
between that and a vector that contains

51
00:01:37,309 --> 00:01:38,755
all of the variable components,

52
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:39,588
x, y and z

53
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:43,536
and the convenience here is
then you can have just a symbol

54
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,090
like a v let's say

55
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,207
which represents this
whole constant vector

56
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,107
and then you can write down,

57
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,777
take the dot product between that

58
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,531
and then have another symbol,

59
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:53,204
maybe a bold faced x

60
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:56,682
which represents a vector that
contains all of the variables

61
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:58,683
and this way, your notation
just kind of looks like

62
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:00,280
a constant times a variable

63
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,672
just like in the single variable world

64
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:03,915
when you have a constant
number times a variable number,

65
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,915
it's kind of like taking a constant vector

66
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:07,387
times a variable vector.

67
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:09,148
And the importance of
writing things down like this

68
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:10,338
is that v could be a vector

69
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,817
that contains not just three numbers

70
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:13,043
but a hundred numbers

71
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:15,857
and then x would have a
hundred corresponding variables

72
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:18,204
and the notation doesn't
become any more complicated.

73
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,762
It's generalizable at
the higher dimensions.

74
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:21,595
So the question is

75
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:23,510
can be we do something similar like that

76
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,952
with our quadratic form?

77
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:25,785
Because you can imagine

78
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:27,896
let's say we started
introducing the variable z

79
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:29,662
then you would have to
have some other term,

80
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:33,039
some other constant times
the xz quadratic term

81
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,329
and then some other constant

82
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:36,244
times the z squared quadratic term

83
00:02:36,244 --> 00:02:38,353
and another one for the yz quadratic term

84
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:39,254
and it would get out of hand

85
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:40,598
and as soon as you
start introducing things

86
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:42,102
like a hundred variables,

87
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:43,457
it would get seriously out of hand

88
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:45,561
because there's a lot of
different quadratic terms

89
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:47,748
so we want a nice way to express this.

90
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:50,616
And I'm just going to kind
of show you how we do it

91
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:53,575
and then we'll work it through
to see why it makes sense.

92
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:56,052
So usually, instead of
thinking of b times xy,

93
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,667
we actually think of this
as two times some constant

94
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,733
times xy

95
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:01,258
and this of course
doesn't make a difference.

96
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:03,180
You would just change what b represents

97
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,504
but you'll see why it's more
convenient to write it this way

98
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:06,932
in just a moment.

99
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:10,177
So the vectorized way to describe
a quadratic form like this

100
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:12,204
is to take a matrix,

101
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:14,531
a two by two matrix since
this is two dimensions

102
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:16,899
where a and c are in the diagonal

103
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:19,428
and then b is on the other diagonal

104
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:21,675
and we always think of these
as being symmetric matrices

105
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:23,623
so if you imagine kind of
reflecting the whole matrix

106
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:25,034
about this line,

107
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:25,928
you'll get the same number

108
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:29,384
so it's important that we
have that kind of symmetry.

109
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:32,053
And now what you do is
you multiply the vector,

110
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:34,498
the variable vector that's got x, y

111
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,627
on the right side of this matrix

112
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:38,633
and then you multiply it again

113
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,715
but you turn it on its side

114
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:42,348
so instead of being a vertical vector,

115
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,956
you transpose it to
being a horizontal vector

116
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:46,263
on the other side.

117
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:47,655
And this is a little bit analogous too

118
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:49,655
having two variables multiplied in.

119
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:52,472
You have two vectors multiplied
in but on either side.

120
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:53,763
And this is a good point by the way

121
00:03:53,763 --> 00:03:56,391
if you are uncomfortable
with matrix multiplication

122
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:57,739
to maybe pause the video,

123
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,862
go find the videos about
matrix multiplication

124
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:01,656
and kind of refresh or learn about that

125
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:02,489
because moving forward,

126
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:03,322
I'm just going to assume

127
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:05,963
that it's something you're familiar with.

128
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:08,435
So going about computing this,

129
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:11,275
first, let's tackle this
right multiplication here.

130
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:14,318
We have a matrix multiplied by a vector.

131
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:16,503
Well, the first component that we get,

132
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,465
we're going to multiply the top row

133
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:19,992
by each corresponding term in the vector

134
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:21,933
so it'll be a times x.

135
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:22,766
a times x

136
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:25,302
plus b times y.

137
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:28,768
Plus b times that second term y

138
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,359
and then similarly for the bottom term,

139
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,997
we'll take the bottom row

140
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:33,507
and multiply the corresponding terms

141
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,144
so b times x.

142
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:35,977
b times x

143
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:38,685
plus c times y.

144
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:40,630
c times y.

145
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:43,860
So that's what it looks like

146
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,480
when we do that right multiplication

147
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,359
and of course we've got to
keep our transposed vector

148
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,457
over there on the right,

149
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,321
on the left side.

150
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:52,629
So now, we have,

151
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,225
this is just a two by one vector now

152
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,385
and this is a one by two.

153
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:57,978
You could think of it
as a horizontal vector

154
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:00,214
or a one by two matrix

155
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:02,172
but now when we multiply these guys,

156
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:04,743
you just kind of line up
the corresponding terms.

157
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:07,392
You'll have x multiplied by
that entire top expression

158
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:10,903
so x multiplied by ax plus by.

159
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:11,736
ax plus by

160
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,602
and then we add that to the second term y

161
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:19,239
multiplied by the second term of this guy

162
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,790
which is bx plus cy

163
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,290
so y multiplied by

164
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:24,645
bx plus cy

165
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,898
and all of these are numbers
so we can simplify it

166
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:32,024
once we start distributing the first term

167
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:33,782
is x times a times x

168
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,449
so that's ax squared

169
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:39,788
and then the next term
is x times b times y

170
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:41,538
so that's b times xy.

171
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,752
Over here, we have y times b times x

172
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:47,526
so that's the same thing as b times xy

173
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:49,061
so that's kind of why we have,

174
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:50,778
why it's convenient to write a two there

175
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:53,880
because that naturally
comes out of our expansion.

176
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,777
And then the last term
is y times c times y

177
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,527
so that's cy squared.

178
00:06:00,123 --> 00:06:02,299
So we get back the original quadratic form

179
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:04,474
that we were shooting for.

180
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:07,801
ax squared plus two bxy plus cy squared

181
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,685
That's how this entire term expands.

182
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,113
As you kind of work it through,

183
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:14,384
you end up with the same
quadratic expression.

184
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:17,403
Now, the convenience
of this quadratic form

185
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:19,276
being written with a matrix like this

186
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:20,847
is that we can write
this more abstractally

187
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,439
and instead of writing
the whole matrix in,

188
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,508
you could just let a letter like m

189
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:26,964
represent that whole matrix

190
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:29,267
and then take the vector
that represents the variable,

191
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:30,982
maybe a bold faced x

192
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:32,665
and you would multiply it on the right

193
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:34,900
and then you transpose it
and multiply it on the left

194
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,043
so typically you denote that

195
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:38,447
by putting a little t as a superscript

196
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:41,578
so x transposed multiplied by

197
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,264
the matrix from the left

198
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:45,007
and this expression,

199
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:49,479
this is what a quadratic form
looks like in vectorized form

200
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:50,499
and the convenience is the same

201
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:51,973
as it was in the linear case.

202
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:52,952
Just like v could represent

203
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:54,954
something that had a hundred
different numbers in it

204
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:56,994
and x would have a hundred
different constants,

205
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:58,344
you could do something similar here

206
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:01,285
where you can write that same expression

207
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:03,449
even if the matrix m is super huge.

208
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:04,512
Let's just see what this would look like

209
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:07,045
in a three dimensional circumstance so,

210
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:08,502
actually, I'll need more room

211
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:10,072
so I'll go down even further.

212
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:14,136
So we have x transpose
multiplied by the matrix

213
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:16,597
multiplied by x, bold faced x

214
00:07:16,597 --> 00:07:18,573
and let's say instead this represented,

215
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,906
you have x then y then z,

216
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:23,719
our transposed vector

217
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:24,986
and then our matrix,

218
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,736
our matrix let's say was a, b, c,

219
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,506
d, e, f and because it
needs to be symmetric,

220
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:34,666
whatever term is in this spot here

221
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,053
needs to be the same as over here

222
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:38,180
kind of when you reflect
it about that diagonal.

223
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,915
Similarly, c, that's going
to be the same term here

224
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:42,525
and e would be over here.

225
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:45,485
So there's only really six
free terms that you have

226
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:47,529
but if fills up this entire matrix

227
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:48,362
and then on the right side,

228
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:50,025
we would multiply that by

229
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:50,858
x, y, z.

230
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,958
Now, I won't work it out in this video

231
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,869
but you can imagine actually
multiplying this matrix

232
00:07:57,869 --> 00:07:58,901
by this vector

233
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:01,388
and then multiplying the
corresponding vector that you get

234
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:03,109
by this transposed vector

235
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:04,994
and you'll get some kind of quadratic form

236
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:06,143
with three variables

237
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,427
and the point is you'll
get a very complicated one

238
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,751
but it's very simple to
express things like this.

239
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,811
So with that tool in hand,

240
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,644
in the next video,

241
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:14,629
I will talk about how
we can use this notation

242
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,957
to express the quadratic approximations

243
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:18,438
for multivariable functions.

244
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:19,271
See you then.
