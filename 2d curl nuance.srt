00:00:00,764 --> 00:00:01,673
- [Voiceover] In the last couple videos

2
00:00:01,673 --> 00:00:03,877
I've been talking about
curl where if we have

3
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:05,702
a two dimensional vector field V

4
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:08,224
defined with component functions P and Q,

5
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:11,014
I've said that the 2D
curl of that function V

6
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:14,453
gives you a new function that
also takes in x and y's inputs

7
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:16,834
and it's formula is the
partial derivative of Q

8
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,075
with respect to x

9
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:21,101
minus the partial derivative
of P with respect to y.

10
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:23,316
And my hope is that this
is more than just a formula

11
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:24,507
and that you can understand

12
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:28,237
how this represents fluid
rotation in two dimensions

13
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,429
but what I want to do here is show

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,811
how the original intuition
I gave for this formula

15
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:33,493
might be a little oversimplified

16
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:35,207
because for example, if we look at this,

17
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:38,140
the partial Q, partial x component,

18
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,220
I said that you can imagine
that Q at some point

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,884
starting off a little bit
negative so the y component

20
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:44,483
of the output is a little negative,

21
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,740
then as you move positively
in the x direction,

22
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,548
it goes to being zero

23
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,648
and then it goes to being
a little bit positive,

24
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:52,006
and with this particular picture,

25
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:53,887
it's hopefully a little bit
clear why this can correspond

26
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,479
to counter-clockwise
rotation in the fluid,

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,621
but this is only a very
specific circumstance

28
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,734
for what partial Q,
partial x being positive

29
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:01,567
could look like.

30
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:05,099
It might also look like Q's
starting a little bit positive

31
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,907
and then as you move in the x direction,

32
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:10,428
it becomes even more positive
and then even more positive.

33
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:12,654
And according to the formula,
this should contribute

34
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:14,461
as much to positive curl

35
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:17,867
as this very clear-cut whirlpool example,

36
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:19,769
and to illustrate what
this might look like,

37
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:22,266
if we take a look at
this vector field here,

38
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:23,782
if we look at the center, this is kinda

39
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:28,379
the clear-cut whirlpool
counter-clockwise rotation example.

40
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,929
And if we play the fluid
flow, the fluid does indeed

41
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:33,175
rotate counter-clockwise in the region.

42
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:36,467
But contrast that with what
goes on over here on the right.

43
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:40,051
This doesn't look like
rotation in that sense at all.

44
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:42,009
Instead the fluid
particles are just kind of

45
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,157
rushing up through it.

46
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:47,049
But in fact, the curl in
this region is going to be

47
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,838
just as strong as it is over here,

48
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,071
and I'll show that with a formula

49
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:51,952
and kind of computing it
through in just a moment,

50
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:54,293
but the image that you
might have in your mind

51
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:55,891
is to imagine a paddle wheel of sorts

52
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:58,138
where let's say it's got
arms kind of like that

53
00:01:58,138 --> 00:02:01,544
and then you hold down with
your thumb that middle portion,

54
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:03,477
so even though the paddle
wheel left to its own devices

55
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:05,417
would just fly up, I want to say,

56
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,135
let's say you're holding
that down with your thumb

57
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:08,733
but it's free to rotate.

58
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:11,732
Then the vectors on its
left are pointing up

59
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,156
but less strongly than
the vectors on its right

60
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:17,072
which are even greater, so
if you imagine that setup

61
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:18,994
and you have your paddle wheel there,

62
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:21,042
then when you play the fluid rotation,

63
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,192
holding your thumb down

64
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:24,900
but letting the paddle
wheel rotate freely,

65
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,716
it's also going to rotate just as it would

66
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:30,799
over here in the easier
to see whirlpool example.

67
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:34,312
And in terms of the formula,

68
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:37,269
this is because a situation
like this one here,

69
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:40,328
where Q goes from being
negative to zero to positive,

70
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,776
should be treated just the
same as a situation like this

71
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:44,709
as far as 2d curls is concerned,

72
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,342
because this term in the 2d curl formula

73
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:50,550
is going to come out the
same for either one of these.

74
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,897
And it's worth pointing out, by the way,

75
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:54,238
curl isn't something that
mathematicians and physicists

76
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:57,028
came across trying to
understand fluid flow.

77
00:02:57,028 --> 00:03:00,445
Instead, they found this
term as being significant

78
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:02,545
and various other
formulas and circumstances

79
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,653
and I think electromagnetism
might be where

80
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:06,651
it originally came about.

81
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:08,801
But then in trying to
understand this formula,

82
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:11,392
they realized that you can give
a fluid flow interpretation

83
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,858
that gives a very deep
understanding of what's going on

84
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,959
beyond just the symbols themselves.

85
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,176
So let me go ahead and
walk through this example

86
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:22,008
in terms of the formula
representing the vector field.

87
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:26,175
It's a relatively
straightforward formula actually.

88
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:28,641
So P and Q,

89
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:33,582
that x component is going to be negative y

90
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:37,072
and the y component, Q, is equal to x.

91
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:38,869
So when we apply our 2d curl formula

92
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:41,335
and apply the partial Q with respect to x,

93
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:43,968
so partial of this second
component with respect to x

94
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:44,968
is just one,

95
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:49,767
and then we subtract off the
partial of P with respect to y

96
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,491
which up here is negative one

97
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,730
because P is just equal to negative y.

98
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,422
So the 2d curl is equal to two

99
00:03:57,422 --> 00:03:59,512
and in particular, it's a constant two

100
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:02,561
that doesn't depend on x and
y, which is pretty unusual,

101
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,977
most times that you apply
2d curl to a vector field

102
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,181
you're going to get some
kind of function of x and y.

103
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,780
But the fact that this is constant,

104
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,162
tells us that when we look
over at this fluid flow,

105
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:14,652
the sense in which curl,
the formula for curl

106
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:17,202
wants to say that rotation
happens around the center

107
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:19,344
is just as strong as
it's supposed to happen

108
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:20,984
over here on the right,

109
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:22,834
or anywhere on the plane for that matter.

110
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:23,667
So if we're playing this

111
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,948
and if you imagine you have
the paddle wheel in the center,

112
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:28,257
evidently it would be
rotating just as quickly

113
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:30,260
as the paddle on the right
even though it might,

114
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,041
I don't know, to me, that
feels a little unintuitive

115
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,524
cause the one on the right I'm thinking,

116
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,186
okay, you know, maybe there's
a little bit more torque

117
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:38,066
on the right side than
there is on the left

118
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,832
and that's kind of a
counter-balancing act,

119
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:41,823
but the idea that that's actually the same

120
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,182
as the very clear-cut, I see
the counter-clockwise rotation

121
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:47,466
with my eyes, example in the center,

122
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,483
does seem a little unusual.

123
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:51,636
But I think it's important to understand

124
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:53,402
what else two dimensional
curl can look like

125
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:57,069
and what else this formula
might be representing.

126
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:59,440
So with that, I'll see you next video.
