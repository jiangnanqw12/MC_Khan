00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:01,870
- [Instructor] Hey everyone,

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,834
so in the next couple of videos,

3
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:04,153
I'm going to be talking about a different

4
00:00:04,153 --> 00:00:06,310
sort of optimization problem,

5
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,268
something called a Constrained
Optimization problem,

6
00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:12,460
and an example of this is
something where you might see,

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,709
you might be asked to maximize

8
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,153
some kind of multi-variable function,

9
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:20,292
and let's just say it was the function

10
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:23,875
f of x,y is equal to x squared, times y.

11
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:27,975
But that's not all you're asked to do,

12
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:30,021
you're subject to a certain constraint

13
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:31,283
where you're only allowed values of

14
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:33,366
x and y on a certain set,

15
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:36,996
and I'm just going to say,

16
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:39,477
the set of all values of x and y,

17
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:43,644
such that, x squared plus
y squared, equals one.

18
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,245
And this is something you might

19
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:49,491
recognize as the unit circle,

20
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:52,987
this particular constraint
that I've put on here,

21
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,763
this is the unit circle.

22
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:58,210
So one way that you might think
about a problem like this,

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,468
you know, you're maximizing a
certain two-variable function,

24
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:03,705
is to first think of the
graph of that function.

25
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:05,110
That's what I have pictured here,

26
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,461
is the graph of f of x,y,
equals x squared, times y.

27
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:11,834
And now this constraint,
x squared plus y squared,

28
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:14,873
is basically just a
subset of the x,y plane.

29
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:16,563
So if we look at it head on here,

30
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:18,285
and we look at the x,y plane,

31
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:20,009
this circle represents all of

32
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,176
the points x,y, such that, this holds.

33
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:25,480
And what I've actually drawn here

34
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,113
isn't the circle on the x,y plane,

35
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:30,287
but I've projected it up onto the graph.

36
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,450
So this is showing you
basically the values

37
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,502
where this constraint holds,

38
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:37,969
and also what they look like when graphed.

39
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:40,177
So the way you can think
about a problem like this,

40
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:42,320
is that you're looking on this circle,

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,781
this kind of projected
circle onto the graph,

42
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:46,661
and looking for the highest points.

43
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:47,878
And you might notice kind of here,

44
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:50,679
there's sort of a peak
on that wiggly circle,

45
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,268
and over here there's another one,

46
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:53,801
and then the low points would be,

47
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:57,219
you know, around that
point and around over here.

48
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,480
Now this is good,

49
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,869
and I think this a nice way to

50
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,993
sort of wrap your head around
what this problem is asking,

51
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:05,591
but there's actually a
better way to visualize it,

52
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:08,814
in terms of finding the actual solution,

53
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:11,244
and that's to look only in the x,y plane,

54
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:12,973
rather than trying to graph things,

55
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:16,253
and just limit our perspective
to the input space.

56
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:18,494
So what I have here are the contour lines

57
00:02:18,494 --> 00:02:21,613
for f of x,y equals x
squared plus y squared.

58
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:22,623
And if you're unfamiliar with

59
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:24,589
contour lines or a contour map,

60
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:25,729
I have a video on that,

61
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,139
you can go back and take a look,

62
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,722
it's going to be pretty crucial

63
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:31,783
for the next couple videos
to have a feel for that.

64
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:34,057
But basically, each one
of these lines represents

65
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:36,421
a certain constant value for f.

66
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,875
So for example, one of them,

67
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:41,858
one of them might represent
all of the values of x and y,

68
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:45,912
where f of x,y is equal to, you know, two,

69
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:47,675
right, so if you looked
at all of the values

70
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:49,266
of x and y where this is true,

71
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:51,661
you'd find yourself on one of these lines,

72
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:53,838
and each line represents
a different possible value

73
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:57,171
for what this constant here actually is.

74
00:02:58,275 --> 00:02:59,108
So what I'm going to do here,

75
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:00,671
is I'm actually going to just zoom in

76
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:04,085
on one particular contour line, right.

77
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:05,683
So this here is something
that I'm going to vary,

78
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:07,358
where I'm going to be able to change

79
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:10,328
what the constant we're
setting f equal to is,

80
00:03:10,328 --> 00:03:13,053
and look at how the contour
line changes as a result.

81
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:16,040
So for example, if I
put it around here-ish,

82
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,650
what you're looking at
is the contour line,

83
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,067
the contour line for f of x,y equals 0.1.

84
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:26,816
So all of the values on
these two blue lines here

85
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:30,733
tell you what values
of x and y satisfy 0.1.

86
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:34,708
But on the other hand, I
could also shift this guy up,

87
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,170
and maybe I'll shift it up,

88
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,442
I'm going to set to where that

89
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:39,929
constant is actually equal to one,

90
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,607
so that would be kind of an alternative,

91
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:44,090
we'll just kind of separate over here.

92
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,173
That would be the line where f of x,y

93
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:51,303
is set equal to one, itself.

94
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:52,921
And the main thing I
want to highlight here,

95
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:56,094
is that at some values, like 0.1,

96
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:59,004
this contour line
intersects with the circle,

97
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,898
it intersects with our constraint.

98
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:04,914
And let's just thing
about what that means,

99
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,855
if there's a point, x and y,

100
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,484
on that intersection there,

101
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:12,031
that basically gives us a
pair of numbers, x and y,

102
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:14,782
such that, this is true,

103
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:17,499
that fact that f of x,y equals 0.1,

104
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:21,666
and also that x squared
plus y squared equals one.

105
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:23,910
So it means this is something that

106
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,098
actually exists and is possible.

107
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,625
And in fact, we can see
that there is four different

108
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,883
pairs of numbers where that's true,

109
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:30,884
where they intersect here,

110
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:32,510
where they intersect over here,

111
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,382
and then the other two,

112
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:35,428
kind of symmetrically on that side.

113
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:37,599
But on the other hand, if
we look as this other world,

114
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:41,766
where we shift up to the
line f of x,y equals one,

115
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,841
this never intersects with the constraint.

116
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:48,008
So what that means is x,y,

117
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:53,751
the pairs of numbers
that satisfy this guy,

118
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,684
are off the constraint,

119
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:57,918
they're off of that circle,

120
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:00,918
x squared plus y squared equals one.

121
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:03,201
So what that tells us,

122
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:05,749
as we try to maximize this function,

123
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:07,344
subject to this constraint,

124
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:10,030
is that we can never get as high as one.

125
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,700
0.1 would be achievable, and in fact,

126
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,684
if we kind of go back to
that, and we look at 0.1,

127
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,121
if I upped that value,

128
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:21,168
and you know, changed
it to the line where,

129
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:24,665
instead what you're looking at is 0.2,

130
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:25,498
that's also possible,

131
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:27,462
because it intersects with the circle.

132
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:29,000
And in fact, you could
play around with it,

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,204
and increase it a little bit more,

134
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:33,790
and if I go to 0.3, instead,

135
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,460
and I go over here and I say,
0.3, that's also possible.

136
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,979
And what we're basically trying to do

137
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,775
is find the maximum value
that we can put here,

138
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,538
the maximum value so that if we look at

139
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:48,430
the line that represents f
of x,y equals that value,

140
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,055
it still intersects with the circle.

141
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:54,545
And the key here, the key observation,

142
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:56,347
is that that maximum value happens

143
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:58,680
when these guys are tangent.

144
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:00,898
And in the next video,

145
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:02,187
I'll start going into the details

146
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:03,998
of how we can use that observation,

147
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,810
this notion of tangency,
to solve the problem,

148
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,956
to find the actual value of x and y

149
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:11,929
that maximizes this,
subject to the constraint.

150
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:13,817
But in the interim, I kind
of want you to mull on that,

151
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:15,951
and think a little bit about
how you might use that.

152
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,067
What does tangency mean here?

153
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,918
How can you take advantage
of certain other notions

154
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,084
that we've learned about
in multi-variable calculus,

155
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:23,885
like, hint, hint, the gradient,

156
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,851
to actually solve something like this.

157
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,326
So with that, I will see you next video.
