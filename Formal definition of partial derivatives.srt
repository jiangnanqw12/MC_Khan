1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:00,915
- [Voiceover] So, I've talked about

2
00:00:00,915 --> 00:00:04,266
the partial derivative
and how you compute it,

3
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:06,223
how you interpret in terms of graphs,

4
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:09,070
but what I'd like to do here
is give its formal definition.

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,771
So, it's the kind of
thing, just to remind you,

6
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:14,294
that applies to a function that
has a multi-variable input.

7
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:16,401
So, X, Y, and you know,
I'll emphasize that

8
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:19,153
it could actually be a
number of other inputs.

9
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:21,177
You could have 100 inputs, or something

10
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:24,006
like that, and as with
a lot of things here,

11
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:25,233
I think it's helpful to take a look at

12
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,058
the one dimensional
analogy and think about

13
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:32,169
how we define the derivative,
just the ordinary derivative,

14
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:34,252
when you have a function
that's just one variable.

15
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:36,455
You know, this would be
just something simple,

16
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:38,967
F of X, and you know, if you're thinking

17
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:42,437
in the back of your mind that
it's a function like F of X

18
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:45,212
equals X squared, and
the way to think about

19
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,647
the definition of this is
to just actually spell out

20
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,832
how we interpret this
D F and D X, and then

21
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:52,851
slowly start to tighten it
up into a formalization.

22
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:55,126
So, you might be thinking of
the graph of this function.

23
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:57,655
You know, maybe it's some
kind of curve, and when you

24
00:00:57,655 --> 00:00:59,739
think of evaluating it
at some point, you know,

25
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:02,793
let's say you're
evaluating it at a point A,

26
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:07,103
you're imagining D X here as
representing a slight nudge,

27
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:09,621
just a slight nudge in the input value.

28
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,369
So, this is in the X direction.

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,079
Got your X coordinate, your output,

30
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,687
F of X is what the Y axis
represents here, and then

31
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:21,568
you're thinking of D F as
being the resulting nudge here,

32
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,832
the resulting change to the function.

33
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:26,281
So, when we formalize this,
we're gonna be thinking of

34
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:30,434
a fraction that's gonna
represent D F over D X, and I'll

35
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:31,594
leave myself some room.

36
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:34,328
You can probably anticipate
why if you know where

37
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:38,370
this is going, and instead
of saying D X, I'll say H.

38
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,284
So instead of thinking
D X is that tiny nudge,

39
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:45,243
you'll think H, and I'm not
sure why H is used necessarily,

40
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:47,379
but just having some
kind of variable that you

41
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:49,637
think of as getting
small, maybe all the other

42
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:51,224
letters in the alphabet were taken.

43
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:53,024
Now, when you actually
say, what do we mean by

44
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:56,565
the resulting change in
F, we should be writing,

45
00:01:56,565 --> 00:02:00,108
as well, where does it go after you nudge?

46
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:02,590
So, when you take, you
know, from that input point,

47
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,077
plus that nudge, plus that little H,

48
00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:07,353
what's the difference
between that and the original

49
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:10,003
function, or the original value of

50
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:11,855
the function, at that point?

51
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:15,201
So, this top part is really
what's representing D F.

52
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:19,194
You know, this is what's
representing D F over here,

53
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:21,633
but you don't do this for
any actual value of H.

54
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:24,656
You don't do it for any specific nudge.

55
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:27,074
Largely, the whole point
of calculus is that you're

56
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:31,702
considering the limit as
H goes to zero of this,

57
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:35,078
and this is what makes
concrete the idea of, you know,

58
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:37,496
a tiny little nudge or a
tiny little resulting change.

59
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:39,548
It's not that it's any specific one.

60
00:02:39,548 --> 00:02:41,586
You're taking the limit,
and you know, you could

61
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:43,428
get into the formal definition of a limit,

62
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:45,602
but it gives you room for rigor as soon as

63
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:47,219
you start writing something like this.

64
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,004
Now, over in the multi-variable
world, very similar story.

65
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:54,491
We can pretty much do the
same thing, and we're gonna

66
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,585
look at our original
fraction, and just start

67
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:59,165
to formalize what we think of each of

68
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:01,212
these variables as representing.

69
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:03,940
That partial X, still it's
common to use the letter H,

70
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,269
just to represent a tiny nudge in

71
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,459
the X direction, and now if we think about

72
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,881
what is that nudge, and here, let me

73
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:11,303
draw it out, actually.

74
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:13,607
The way that I kinda
like to draw this out is

75
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:16,601
you think of your entire input space as,

76
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,639
you know, the X Y plane.

77
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,927
If it was more variables, this would be

78
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:20,606
a high dimensional space,
and you're thinking

79
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:22,905
at some point, you know,
maybe you're thinking of it

80
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:26,044
as A B, or maybe I should specify that,

81
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:28,172
actually, where we're doing this

82
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:31,339
at a specific point how you define it.

83
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,756
We're doing this at a very specific point,

84
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,128
A B, and when you're
thinking of your tiny little

85
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:40,505
change in X, you'd be thinking, you know,

86
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:43,258
a tiny little nudge in the X direction,

87
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:46,307
a tiny little shift there,
and the entire function

88
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:49,119
maps that input space, whatever it is, to

89
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,501
the real number line.

90
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,975
This is your output
space, and you're saying,

91
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:55,726
hey, how does that tiny
nudge influence the output?

92
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:58,376
I've drawn this diagram
a lot, this loose sketch.

93
00:03:58,376 --> 00:03:59,446
I think it's actually a pretty good model,

94
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:00,710
because once we start thinking of

95
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,577
higher dimensional outputs
or things like that,

96
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,594
it's pretty flexible, and
you're thinking of this

97
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,849
as your partial X, your changing

98
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,127
the X direction, and
this is that resulting

99
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:10,953
change for the function.

100
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:12,367
But, we go back up here, and we say,

101
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,595
well what does that mean, right?

102
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:16,879
If H represents that tiny
change to your X value,

103
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,729
well then you have to evaluate
the function at the point A,

104
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,853
but plus that H, and you're adding it

105
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,811
to the X value, that first component,

106
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:28,736
just because this is
the partial derivative

107
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,629
with respect to X, and the point B

108
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,689
just remains unchanged, right?

109
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:36,396
So, this is you evaluating it, kind of, at

110
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:37,971
the new point, and you have to say,

111
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:40,073
what's the difference
between that and the old

112
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:44,233
evaluation, where it was just at A and B.

113
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,191
And that's it.

114
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:49,623
That's the formal definition
of your partial derivative,

115
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,767
except, oh, the most
important part, right?

116
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,305
The most important part, given that

117
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:55,743
this is calculus is that
we're not doing this

118
00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:59,743
for any specific value
of H, but we're actually,

119
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:02,853
let me just move this guy.

120
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:05,482
Give a little bit of room here.

121
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:06,515
Yes.

122
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,973
But, we're actually taking the limit

123
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,556
here, limit, as H goes to zero,

124
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,612
and what this means is you're
not considering any specific

125
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,981
size of D X, any specific size of this.

126
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,703
Really, this is H, considering
the notation up here,

127
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:22,398
but any size for that partial X.

128
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:24,392
You're imagining that nudge shrinking

129
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:26,706
more and more and more,
and the resulting change

130
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:28,123
shrinks more and more and more, and you're

131
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:31,390
wondering what the ratio
between them approaches.

132
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,829
So, that would be the partial derivative

133
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:35,028
with respect to X, and just for practice,

134
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:36,872
let's actually write out
what the partial derivative

135
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:38,367
with respect to Y would be.

136
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,660
So, we'll get rid of some of this

137
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,952
one dimensional analogy stuff here.

138
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:44,349
Don't need that anymore,
and let's just think about

139
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,660
what the partial
derivative with respect to

140
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,298
a different variable would be.

141
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:51,553
So, if we were doing it
as partial derivative

142
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:55,800
of F with respect to Y,
now we're nudging slightly

143
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
in the other direction, right?

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,413
We're nudging in the Y
direction, and you'd be thinking,

145
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,842
okay, so we're still
gonna divide something

146
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:03,610
by that nudge, and again I'm
just using the same variable.

147
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,892
Maybe it would be clearer
to write something like

148
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:08,364
the change in Y, or to
go up here and write

149
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:09,897
something like, you know, the change

150
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:12,912
in X, and people will do
that, but it's less common.

151
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:14,477
I think people just kinda want

152
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:17,600
the standard go-to limiting variable.

153
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,923
But, this time when you're considering

154
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:21,840
what is the resulting
change, oh, and again,

155
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,998
I always forget to write
in we're evaluating this

156
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:28,748
at a specific point, at
a specific point A B,

157
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:35,694
and as a result, maybe I'll give myself

158
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:38,335
a little bit more room here.

159
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,847
So, we're taking this whole thing,

160
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:45,040
dividing by H, but what is
the resulting change in F?

161
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,310
This time you say F, the new
value is still gonna be at A,

162
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,941
but the change happens
for that second variable.

163
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:54,508
It's gonna be that B, B plus H.

164
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:56,060
So, you're adding that nudge to

165
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,835
the Y value, and as
before, you subtract off.

166
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,774
You see the difference
between that and how you

167
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:04,095
evaluate it at the
original point, and again,

168
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:06,194
the whole reason I move
this over and give myself

169
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:09,218
some room is because
we're taking the limit,

170
00:07:09,218 --> 00:07:12,637
as this H goes to zero, and the way that

171
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:14,058
you're thinking about
this is very similar.

172
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,746
It's just that when you change the input

173
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:19,301
by adding H to the Y value,
you're shifting it upwards.

174
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:22,532
So, again, this is the partial derivative,

175
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,797
the formal definition of
the partial derivative.

176
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:26,624
Looks very similar to
the formal definition of

177
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:30,267
the derivative, but I just
always think about this

178
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,325
as spelling out what we mean by

179
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:35,031
partial Y and partial F,
and kinda spelling out

180
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:36,876
why it is that the Leibniz's came up

181
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:38,757
with this notation in the first place.

182
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,858
Well, I don't know if Leibniz
came up with the partials,

183
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:44,548
but the D F, D X portion, and this is good

184
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,829
to keep in the back of your mind,

185
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:47,697
especially as we introduce new notions,

186
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:50,155
new types of multi-variable derivatives,

187
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:51,627
like the directional derivative.

188
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:54,227
 I think it helps clarify
what's really go on

189
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:55,454
in certain contexts.

190
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:56,380
Great.

191
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,213
See ya next video.
