00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:02,160
- [Instructor] So where we
left off we have these two

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,529
different equations that we wanna solve

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,000
and there's three unknowns.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,299
There's s, the tons of
steel that you're using,

5
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,599
h the hours of labor, and then lambda,

6
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:12,501
this Lagrange Multiplier we introduced

7
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:15,387
that's basically a
proportionality constant

8
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:18,251
between the gradient vectors
of the revenue function

9
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,897
and the constraint function.

10
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:23,380
And always the third equation
that we're dealing with here

11
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,912
to solve this, is the constraint itself.

12
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:27,627
That gives us another equation
that'll help solve for

13
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:30,198
h and s, and ultimately lambda,

14
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:32,302
if that's something that you want as well.

15
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:33,511
So it's kind of a first pass here,

16
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,104
I'm gonna do a little more simplifying

17
00:00:35,104 --> 00:00:36,354
but I'm gonna make a substitution

18
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:37,879
that'll make this easier for us.

19
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:41,075
So I see s over h here, and
they're both to the same power,

20
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,764
so I feel it might be a little bit easier

21
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:46,514
if I just substitute u
in for s divided by h.

22
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:50,054
And what that'll let me do, is rewrite

23
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:53,304
this first equation here as 200 thirds,

24
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:58,156
200 thirds times u to
the power of one third.

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,906
And that's equal to 20 times lambda.

26
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:06,346
And then likewise, what
that means for this guy,

27
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:09,773
is, well, this is h over s, not s over h,

28
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:12,426
so that one's gonna be 100 thirds,

29
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:14,777
not times u to the power of two thirds,

30
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:17,944
but times u to the negative two thirds

31
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:21,281
because we swapped the h and s here.

32
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,645
So that's u to the negative two thirds

33
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:27,754
and this is just to make it a
little bit cleaner, I think.

34
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,921
We kind of want to treat h
and s in the same package.

35
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:34,661
Now I'm gonna go ahead and
put all the constants together

36
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,067
and then I'm gonna take this guy

37
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:39,714
and multiply it by three divided by 200,

38
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:41,736
multiply both sides of
that just to cancel out

39
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:44,110
what's on the left side here.

40
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,360
And what that's gonna give
me, and I'll go ahead and

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,323
write it over here, kind
of all over the place,

42
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:51,754
u to the one third is equal to,

43
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:54,090
let's see three over 200, so that 20

44
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,876
almost cancels out with the
200, it just leaves a 10,

45
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:59,876
so that's gonna give me three tenths

46
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:03,424
of lambda.

47
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:06,124
And then similarly over here,

48
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:08,197
I'm gonna take this full equation

49
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:10,947
and multiply it by three over 100

50
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:14,366
and what that's gonna leave me with

51
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:17,612
is that u to the negative two thirds,

52
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:19,567
u to the negative two thirds is equal to,

53
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:22,036
let's see this 2,000
when we divide it by 100

54
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:25,342
becomes 20, and that 20 times three is 60,

55
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:27,842
so that'll be 60 times lambda.

56
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:32,852
Alright, so now I want a way
to simplify each of these,

57
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,381
and what I notice is they look
pretty similar on each side,

58
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:38,191
you know it's something
related to u equal to lambda,

59
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,433
so if I can get this in a form

60
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:42,817
where I'm really isolating
u, that would be great.

61
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:44,648
The way I'm gonna do this
is I'm gonna multiply

62
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:47,566
each one of them by u to the two thirds,

63
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,329
so I'm gonna multiply it into this guy

64
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,298
and I'm gonna multiply it into that guy,

65
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:54,555
because on the top, it's
gonna turn this into just u,

66
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:56,357
which will be nice, and on the bottom

67
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:58,111
it'll cancel out that u entirely.

68
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,838
So it feels like it'll
make both of these nicer,

69
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:02,278
even though it might make the
right side a little uglier,

70
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:04,016
those right sides will
still kind of be the same,

71
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:05,721
and we'll take advantage of that.

72
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:07,751
So, when I do that to the top part,

73
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,047
like I said, that u to the one third

74
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:12,109
times u to the two thirds ends up being u,

75
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,106
and then on the right side we have

76
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:16,106
our three tenths lambda,

77
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:19,555
but now u to the two thirds.

78
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:23,122
And then on the bottom here, we,

79
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:25,135
when I multiply it by u to the two thirds,

80
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:27,305
the right side becomes
one, 'cause it cancels out

81
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:29,376
with u to the negative two thirds,

82
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,459
and the right side is 60 times lambda

83
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,709
times u to the two thirds.

84
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:39,658
Now these right sides look very similar,

85
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:41,155
and the left sides are quite simple.

86
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:42,628
So I'm gonna multiply this top one

87
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:44,509
by whatever it takes
to make it look exactly

88
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:45,575
like that right side.

89
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:48,581
So in this case I'm gonna
multiply that top by 10,

90
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,249
which will get it to three,
and then by another 20

91
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:53,716
to make that constant 60,
so I'm gonna multiply this

92
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:56,134
entire top equation by 200,

93
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:59,634
and what that gives me is that 200 times u

94
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:03,222
is equal to 60 times lambda

95
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:06,874
times u to the two thirds.

96
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:11,839
And now these two equations,
these two equations

97
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,368
have the same right side.

98
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:15,205
So this is the same as saying,

99
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:18,122
200 times u is equal to, well, one.

100
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:21,478
Because each one of those expressions

101
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,125
equals the same complicated thing.

102
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,554
And now 200 times u, well
that's s divided by h.

103
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:30,948
So this is the same thing as saying 200

104
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:33,115
times s over h equals one,

105
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:37,742
which we can write much more simply as h

106
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,075
is equal to 200

107
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:42,059
times s.

108
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:45,522
Great, so I'm gonna go
ahead and circle that,

109
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:48,267
h is equal to 200 times s.

110
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,700
And now what we apply that to

111
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,789
is the constraint, is the 200 times h

112
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:55,940
plus 2,000 times s equals our budget.

113
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,649
We'll go ahead and kind
of write that down again.

114
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:02,118
That are 20 times h, I think,
20 times the hours of labor

115
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:04,451
plus $2,000 per ton of steel

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,917
is equal to our budget

117
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:11,601
of $20,000, and now we
can just substitute in.

118
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:16,599
Instead of h I'm gonna
write 200 s, so that's 200,

119
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:18,432
sorry, 20 times 200 s,

120
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,423
200 s,

121
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:24,362
plus 2,000

122
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,156
times s

123
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:28,739
is equal to 20,000.

124
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,910
And now this right side, 20
times 200 is equal to 4,000,

125
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,426
and I'm just gonna go
ahead and kind of write

126
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:38,027
so this here

127
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:42,194
is 4,000 s, so the entire
right side of the equation

128
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:45,181
simplifies to 6,000,

129
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,729
6,000 times s

130
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:50,774
is equal to 20,000

131
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,070
and when those cancel
out, what that gives us

132
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,999
is s is equal to 20 divided by six,

133
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:01,416
which is the same as 10 divided by three.

134
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:05,276
So that's how many tons
of steel we should get.

135
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:07,562
S is 10 over three,
then when we apply that

136
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:10,039
to the fact that h is 200 times s,

137
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,271
that's gonna mean that h is equal

138
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,271
to 200 times that value,

139
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:18,924
10 over three, which is equal to

140
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:21,534
2,000,

141
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:23,915
2,000 thirds,

142
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:29,410
2,000 thirds, that's how
many hours of labor we want.

143
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,049
So, evidently in our original problem,

144
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:35,127
where we have this model
for our revenue function

145
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:37,949
for our Widgets with
$20 per hour of labor,

146
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,458
and $2,000 per ton of steel,

147
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,224
with a budget of $20,000, the allocation

148
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:47,341
that you should make is to buy
10 thirds of a ton of steel

149
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:50,091
and 2,000 thirds hours of labor.
