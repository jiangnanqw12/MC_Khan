00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,566
- [Voiceover] Hey guys,
so in the last video

2
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:03,842
I was talking about how
you can define a function

3
00:00:03,842 --> 00:00:05,350
whose graph is a plane,

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,230
and moreover a plane that
passes through a specified point

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,077
and whose orientation
you can somehow specify.

6
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:13,758
And we ended up seeing how
specifying that orientation

7
00:00:13,758 --> 00:00:16,938
comes down to certain partial
derivative information.

8
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:19,654
And first let me just kind of
repeat what the conclusion was

9
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:22,186
but I'll put it in more abstract terms

10
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:24,994
since I did it in a very
specific example last time.

11
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:27,270
So basically if you want
some kind of function

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,222
which gives you a plane that

13
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:30,706
passes through a certain point.

14
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:32,218
Well first let's see
what that point is right.

15
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:36,200
Let's say the point was x
nought, y nought, and z nought.

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,963
So these are constant values

17
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:39,891
and this is my way of
abstractly describing

18
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,563
a single point in space using

19
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:43,979
x nought to represent a constant x value,

20
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,067
y nought to represent constant
y value, that kind of thing.

21
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:49,899
So what it is, is it's gonna
be some sort of other constant

22
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,982
a multiplied by x minus x nought.

23
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,703
So this white x here is the variable

24
00:00:57,703 --> 00:00:59,651
and then x nought is just a constant.

25
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:04,111
Now let me go ahead and
make that parentheses there.

26
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:07,028
Then we add to that b multiplied by

27
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,775
and then b is just some other constant

28
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:11,423
just like a is some other constant

29
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:13,756
multiplied by y minus y nought

30
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:18,419
and then all of that you add z nought.

31
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,295
And now if you were just
presented this as it is

32
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:22,291
it's kind of a lot right,

33
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,267
there's five different constants going on.

34
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,055
But really what this is saying is

35
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:29,163
you want something where
the partial derivative

36
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:31,139
with respect to x is just some constant

37
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:33,715
and you want to be able to
specify what that constant is.

38
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:35,398
And similarly, the partial derivative

39
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:37,225
with respect to y is another constant.

40
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:38,713
And you just want to ensure that this

41
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:41,361
passes through this point
x nought, y nought, z nought.

42
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:44,585
And if you imagine plugging in
x the variable equals x nought

43
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:46,745
the constant this part goes to zero.

44
00:01:46,745 --> 00:01:48,697
Similarly plugging in y nought the constant

45
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:50,181
makes this part go to zero.

46
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,017
So this is a way of
specifying that when you

47
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:55,361
evaluate the function x
nought y nought equals z nought,

48
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:57,313
and that's what makes sure that the graph

49
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:58,937
passes through that point.

50
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:01,097
So with that said let's
start thinking about

51
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:03,905
how you can find the
tangent plane to a graph.

52
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:06,437
And first of all let's think
about what that point is,

53
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:08,433
how you specify such a point.

54
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:11,125
Instead of specifying any
three numbers in space,

55
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,521
because you have to make sure the point

56
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:13,961
is somewhere on the graph,

57
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,633
you instead only specify two.

58
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:18,161
You're basically gonna say
what's the x coordinate

59
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:21,065
and in this case let's say
the x coordinate was one,

60
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:23,433
and then the y coordinate which

61
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:25,173
looks about like negative two.

62
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:28,265
To make it easier I'm just
gonna say it is negative two.

63
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:29,797
Then the z coordinate is specified

64
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:31,097
because this is a graph.

65
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:33,837
Z coordinate is forced
to be whatever the output

66
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:36,669
of the function is at one negative two.

67
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:39,245
So this is gonna be whatever
the output of our function is

68
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:40,912
at one negative two.

69
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:44,101
And f here, f is going to be whatever

70
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,725
function gives us this graph.

71
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:48,533
So maybe I should write
down the actual function

72
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,089
that I'm using for this graph.

73
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:54,089
In this case f which is
a function of x and y

74
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,319
is equal to three minus one third

75
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:03,257
of x squared minus y squared.

76
00:03:03,257 --> 00:03:05,253
So this is the function that we're using

77
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,761
and you evaluate it at that point

78
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,337
and this will give you your
point in three dimensional space

79
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:10,965
that our linear function,

80
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:13,589
that our tangent plane
has to pass through.

81
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:15,445
So we can start writing
out our linear function.

82
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,117
We can say okay so our linear function

83
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:20,138
has a function of x and y.

84
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:21,735
It's gotta make sure it goes through

85
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,856
that one and that negative two,

86
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:24,493
so this is gonna be some constant a

87
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:25,957
that we'll fill in in a moment,

88
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:28,533
multiplied by x minus that one,

89
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:32,993
plus and then b also a constant
we'll specify in a moment,

90
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:35,466
times y minus that negative two,

91
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,799
so it's minus a negative two

92
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,318
and then the thing that we add to it

93
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:43,686
is f of one negative two.

94
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,310
Now let's just go ahead and evaluate that.

95
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,054
Let's say we plug in one to negative two.

96
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:51,221
So if we go up here and we plug
in three minus one third of

97
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:56,714
if x equals one, one third of one squared,

98
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,850
so that's one third one squared,

99
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,262
and then y is negative two.

100
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:04,929
So that would be minus
negative two squared.

101
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:09,195
So that's three minus a third minus four

102
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,874
so the whole thing is equal to

103
00:04:12,874 --> 00:04:15,614
three minus four is negative
one minus another third

104
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:17,614
is negative four thirds.

105
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,254
So that's what we add
to this entire thing.

106
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:23,504
We add negative four thirds

107
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,458
or maybe I should just kind of

108
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,802
make clear the separation here.

109
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,730
So this is our function but we
don't know what a and b are.

110
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,818
Those are things that we need to plug in.

111
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:35,814
Now the whole idea of the tangent plane

112
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:38,554
is that the partial
derivative with respect to x

113
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:41,038
should match that of
the original function.

114
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:42,410
So if we go over to the graph here

115
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,754
and start thinking about
partial derivative information.

116
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:47,446
If we want the partial
derivative with respect to x

117
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:50,234
then you imagine moving purely
in the x direction here.

118
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:54,114
This intersects the graph
along some kind of curve

119
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:56,134
and what the partial
derivative with respect to x

120
00:04:56,134 --> 00:05:00,301
at this point tells you, is
the slope of the tangent line,

121
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,020
in that direction of that point.

122
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,320
So that's what the partial
derivative with respect to x

123
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,804
is telling you and what
you want when you look

124
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:15,984
at the tangent plane is
that the tangent plane

125
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:17,772
also has that same slope.

126
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:19,144
If I lined things up here,

127
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:21,580
you'd want it also to
have that same slope.

128
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,436
So you can specify over here and say a.

129
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:28,012
You want a to be equal
to the partial derivative

130
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:30,916
of the function with respect to x

131
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,816
evaluated at this one negative two.

132
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:38,027
Evaluated at that special
point, one negative two.

133
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:42,027
And similarly b for pretty
much the same reasons

134
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:47,553
and I'll draw it out here
so let's erase this line.

135
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:53,506
So instead of intersecting
it with that slice

136
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:56,038
let's see what movement in
the y direction looks like.

137
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:58,362
So in this case it looks
like a very steep slope right

138
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:01,589
because in this case the
tangent line in that direction

139
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:05,349
is a pretty steep slope
and now when we bring in

140
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:09,229
the tangent plane it
should intersect with that

141
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:13,709
constant x value plane
along that same slope.

142
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,149
Made it kind of messy there

143
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:18,145
but you can see the line formed

144
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,001
by intersecting these two planes

145
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,185
should be that desired tangent,

146
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:23,997
and what that corresponds to in formulas

147
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:27,665
is that this b which represents
the partial derivative of l,

148
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:30,449
l is the tangent plane function,

149
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:33,933
that should be the same as if
we took the partial derivative

150
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:37,137
of f with respect to y at that point,

151
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:39,809
at this point one negative two.

152
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:41,897
And this is stuff that we can compute

153
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:43,061
and that we can figure out.

154
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:45,405
So let's start plugging that in.

155
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,799
First let me just copy this function

156
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,132
because we're gonna need it.

157
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:57,462
Now let's go on down here.

158
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,475
I'm just gonna, let's paste it down here

159
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:03,423
in the bottom because
that's what we'll need.

160
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,071
So let's compute the
partial derivative of f

161
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,723
with respect to x.

162
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:09,415
So we look down here, the
only place where x shows up

163
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:12,991
is in this negative one
third of x squared context

164
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:16,379
so the partial derivative
of f with respect to x

165
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,027
is gonna be just the
derivative of this little guy

166
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:20,955
which is negative, we bring down the two,

167
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:23,038
negative two thirds of x.

168
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:28,339
So when we go ahead and
plug in x equals one

169
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,171
to see what it looks like
when we evaluate at this point

170
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:35,327
that's just gonna be equal
to negative two thirds.

171
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:36,675
So that tells us that a is gonna

172
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:38,531
have to be negative two thirds.

173
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:39,415
Now for similar reasons,

174
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,343
let's go ahead and compute the

175
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:43,711
partial derivative with respect to y.

176
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:46,011
We look down here, the
only place that y shows up

177
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:49,051
in the entire expression
is this negative y squared.

178
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:53,555
So the partial derivative
of f with respect to y

179
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:57,138
is equal to negative
two y, negative two y.

180
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:01,170
And now when we plug in
y equals negative two

181
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,494
what we get is negative two
multiplied coincidentally

182
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,612
by negative two, didn't
have to be the case

183
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,541
that those were the same, and
that whole thing equals four.

184
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:14,469
So the partial derivative
of f with respect to y

185
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:16,033
evaluated at this point one negative two

186
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,357
is equal to four.

187
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:18,865
So if we were to plug
this information back up

188
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,653
into our formula we would replace

189
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:22,257
a with negative two thirds.

190
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:24,650
It would say negative two thirds.

191
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,293
And we would replace b with
four, replace b with four.

192
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:33,221
And that would give us the full formula,

193
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,580
the full formula for the tangent plane.

194
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,232
And this can be kind of
a lot to look at at first

195
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:42,248
because we have to specify the
input point one negative two.

196
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:43,456
And then we had to figure out where

197
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,544
the function evaluates at that point.

198
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:46,984
And then we had to figure out both of the

199
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,328
partial derivatives with respect
to x and with respect to y.

200
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:51,976
But all in all, there's not actually

201
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:54,672
a lot to remember from how
you go about computing this.

202
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:55,808
Looking at the graph actually makes

203
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:57,620
things seem a lot more reasonable

204
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,896
because each of those terms
has an actual meaning.

205
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:03,168
If we look at the one and negative two,

206
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,632
that's just telling us the input,

207
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:06,444
the kind of x and y
coordindates of the input

208
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:07,952
and of course we have to evaluate that

209
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:10,180
because that tells us the z coordinate

210
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,548
that will put us on the graph
corresponding to that point

211
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:15,872
and then to get a tangent plane

212
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:17,079
you just need to specify the two bits of

213
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,027
partial differential information

214
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:20,839
and that will tell you how this graph

215
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,231
needs to be oriented,

216
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,903
and once you start thinking
of things in that way,

217
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:26,227
geometrically, even though
there's a lot going on here,

218
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:28,291
there's five different
numbers you have to put in,

219
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,335
each one of them feels like
of course you need that number

220
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,539
otherwise you couldn't
specify a tangent plane.

221
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,327
There's kind of a lot
of information required

222
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,883
to put it on the appropriate spot.

223
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:39,938
So with that I will see you next video.
