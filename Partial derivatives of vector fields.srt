1
00:00:01,515 --> 00:00:03,001
- [Voiceover] So let's
start thinking about partial

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:05,129
derivatives of vector fields.

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:06,927
So a vector field is a function.

4
00:00:06,927 --> 00:00:09,626
I'll just do a two
dimensional example here.

5
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:12,208
It's gonna be something that
has a two dimensional input.

6
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,691
And then the output has the
same number of dimensions.

7
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:16,048
That's the important part.

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:17,801
And each of these components in the output

9
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:21,016
is gonna depend somehow
on the input variables.

10
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:22,791
So the example I have in mind

11
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,273
will be X times Y as that first component,

12
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:29,440
and then Y squared minus X
squared as that second component.

13
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,985
And you can compute the partial derivative

14
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:34,513
of a guy like this, right?

15
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:36,417
You'll take the partial
derivative with respect to

16
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:37,281
one of the input variables.

17
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:38,313
I'll choose X.

18
00:00:38,313 --> 00:00:39,739
It's always a nice one to start with.

19
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,822
Partial derivative with respect to X.

20
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:45,337
And if we were to actually compute it,

21
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,607
in this case, it's another,
it's a function of X and Y.

22
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:51,106
What you do is you take
the partial derivative

23
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:52,363
component wise.

24
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:54,095
So you to each component in the first one.

25
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,016
You say, okay.

26
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:55,978
X looks like a variable.

27
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:57,635
Y looks like a constant.

28
00:00:57,635 --> 00:00:59,746
The derivative will just be that constant.

29
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:01,984
And then the partial derivative
of the second component.

30
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:03,663
That Y squared looks like a constant.

31
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,266
Derivative of negative X
squared with respect to X.

32
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,516
Negative two X.

33
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:09,994
So analytically,

34
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:11,435
if you know how to take
a partial derivative,

35
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:12,865
you already know how to
take a partial derivative

36
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,472
of vector valued functions
and hence vector fields,

37
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:17,931
but the fun part, the important part here.

38
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:20,354
How do you actually interpret this?

39
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:21,468
And this has everything to do

40
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:23,370
with visualizing it in some way.

41
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,762
So the vector field, the reason
we call it a vector field,

42
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:29,894
is you kind of take the whole X Y plane

43
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:32,007
and you're gonna fill it with vectors.

44
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,938
And concretely, what I mean by that,

45
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:35,022
you'll take a given input.

46
00:01:35,022 --> 00:01:37,954
What's an input you wanna look at?

47
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:39,927
I'll say, maybe one, two.

48
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:41,016
Yeah, let's do that.

49
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:42,516
Let's do one, two.

50
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:45,870
Which would mean you
kinda go X equals one.

51
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,399
And then Y equals two

52
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,429
This input point.

53
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:49,726
Then we want to associate that

54
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:51,781
with the output vector in some way.

55
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:54,477
And so, let's just compute
what it should equal.

56
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:57,532
So when we plug in X equals
one, and Y equals two,

57
00:01:57,532 --> 00:01:59,365
X times Y becomes two.

58
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,279
Y squared minus X squared

59
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,734
becomes two squared minus one squared,

60
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:05,988
so four minus one is three.

61
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:08,842
So we have this vector two,
three that we want to associate

62
00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:10,212
with that input point.

63
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:11,965
And vector fields, you
just attach the two points.

64
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,139
I'm gonna take the vector two, three

65
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,522
and attach it to this guy.

66
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:18,591
So we should have an X component of two

67
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:21,258
and then a Y component of three.

68
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,318
So it's going to end up
looking something like,

69
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,563
let's see, so Y component of three,

70
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,230
something like this.

71
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:31,595
So that'll be the vector and
we attach it to that point.

72
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:34,021
And in principal, you do this
to all the different points.

73
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,015
And if you did, what you'd get
would be something like this.

74
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:38,212
And remember when we represent these,

75
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:40,773
especially with computers,
it tends to lie,

76
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:43,475
where each represented
vector is much, much shorter

77
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:45,247
than it should be in reality,

78
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,624
but you want to squish
them all onto the same page

79
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:49,237
so they don't over run each other.

80
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:51,421
And here, color is
supposed to give a general,

81
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,419
vague sense of relative length.

82
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,462
So ones that are blue should
thought of as much shorter

83
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:56,868
than the ones that are yellow,

84
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,598
but that doesn't really
give a specific thought

85
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:01,207
for how long they should be.

86
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:02,355
But, for partial derivatives,

87
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:04,766
we actually care a lot
about the specifics.

88
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,685
And if you think back to

89
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:08,515
how we interpret partial derivatives

90
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:10,022
in a lot of other contexts,

91
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:13,030
what want to do is imagine
this partial X here

92
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,699
as a slight nudge in
the X direction, right.

93
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,427
So this was our original input,

94
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:19,876
so you might imagine just
nudging it a little bit,

95
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:22,509
and the size of that nudge, as a number,

96
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,460
would be your partial X.

97
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,299
So then the question is,

98
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:28,774
what's the resulting change to the output?

99
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:30,103
And because the output is a vector,

100
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,754
the change to the output is
also going to be a vector.

101
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,607
So what we want is to say

102
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:35,970
there's going to be some other vector

103
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,592
attached to this point, right?

104
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,560
It's going to look very similar.

105
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,946
Maybe it looks like,

106
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:43,408
maybe it looks something like this.

107
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:45,731
So something similar, but
maybe a little bit different.

108
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,616
And you want to take that
difference in vector form.

109
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:50,998
And I'll describe what I mean
by that in just a moment,

110
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,309
and then divide by the size
of that original nudge.

111
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:56,763
So to be much more specific
about what I mean here,

112
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:58,292
if you're comparing two different vectors

113
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,207
and they're rooted in two different spots,

114
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,255
I think a good way to start

115
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,023
is to just move them to a new space

116
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:04,803
where they're rooted in the same spot.

117
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:05,834
So in this case,

118
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,513
I'm gonna kinda just draw
a separate space over here.

119
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:10,274
And be thinking of this as a place

120
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:11,555
for these vectors to live.

121
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,574
And I'm gonna them both on this plane,

122
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:15,600
but I'm gonna root them
each in the origin.

123
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,990
So this first one that
has components two, three,

124
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,457
now let's give it a name, right.

125
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:21,638
Let's call this guy V one, okay.

126
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:22,878
So that'll be V one.

127
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:24,912
And then the nudged
output, the second one,

128
00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:26,245
I'll call V two.

129
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:32,784
And let's say V two is also in this space,

130
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:34,526
and I might exaggerate the difference,

131
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:36,784
just so we can see it here.

132
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:38,905
Let's say it was different in some way.

133
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:40,367
In reality, if it's a small nudge,

134
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,386
it'll be different in
only a very small way.

135
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:45,014
But let's say these were our two vectors.

136
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:47,694
The difference between these guys

137
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:51,066
is going to be a vector
that connects the tips.

138
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:54,066
And I'm gonna call that guy Partial V.

139
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:56,240
And the way you can be thinking about this

140
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,439
is to say that V one, V
one, that original guy,

141
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,735
plus, that tiny nudge, the
difference between them

142
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:05,652
is equal to

143
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,217
the two,

144
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:10,032
you know, the nudged output.

145
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:11,197
And in terms of tip to tail with vectors,

146
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:12,261
you've seen that.

147
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:14,719
Kind of the green vector
plus that blue vector

148
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:17,165
is the same as that pink vector

149
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:19,417
that connects the tail of the original one

150
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,263
to the tip of the new one.

151
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:23,824
So when we're thinking
of a partial derivative,

152
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,741
you're basically saying,

153
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,301
"Hey, what happens if
we take this, the nudge,

154
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:29,302
the size of the nudge of the output,

155
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:32,343
and then we divide it by
the nudge of the input?"

156
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:34,415
So let's thinking of that
original nudge as being,

157
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:38,456
I don't know, of a size of one
half, like zero point five.

158
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:41,631
As the change in the X direction.

159
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:43,637
Then that would mean, when
you go over here and say

160
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:44,644
what's that DV?

161
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,121
That changing vector V divided by the X,

162
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:50,249
you'd be dividing it by zero point five,

163
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,993
and in principle, you'd be thinking of,

164
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,603
that would mean that your
kind of scaling this by two.

165
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:58,399
As if to say, this
little DV is one half of

166
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,383
some other vector.

167
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:01,951
And that other vector is what
the partial derivative is.

168
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:04,263
So this other vector
here, the full blue guy,

169
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:08,233
would be DV, you know,
scaled down or scaled up,

170
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,387
however you want to think about it,

171
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:10,703
by that partial X.

172
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,015
And that's what makes it such the,

173
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:13,818
you know, in principle if this partial X

174
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:16,055
change was really small, like one 100th

175
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:17,830
and the output nudge
was also really small,

176
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,087
it's like one 100th,

177
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,676
or you know something on that order,

178
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:22,508
it wouldn't be specifically that.

179
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,227
Then the DVDX, that change,

180
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:27,003
would still be a normal sized vector.

181
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:28,389
And the direction that it points

182
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,731
is still kind of an indication

183
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:31,782
of the direction that this
green vector should change

184
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:34,384
as you're scooting over.

185
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:37,355
So just be concrete and
actually compute this guy,

186
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,639
let's say we were to take
this partial derivative

187
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,542
partial V with respect to X

188
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,931
and evaluate it at that point one, two

189
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:46,739
that we're just dealing with, one, two.

190
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,215
What that would mean, Y is equal to two,

191
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:51,052
so that first component is two

192
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:52,366
and then X is equal to one,

193
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,255
so that next should be negative two.

194
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:57,621
And then we can see just
how wrong my drawing was

195
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:58,454
to start here.

196
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:00,532
I was just kind of guessing
what the pink vector would be,

197
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:01,365
but I guess it changes

198
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:03,118
in the direction of two, negative two.

199
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:06,762
So that should be something,
here I'll erase the,

200
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:10,679
what turns out to be,
the wrong direction here.

201
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:13,410
Get rid of this guy.

202
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:18,564
And I guess the change would
be in the direction kind of two

203
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,052
as the X component,

204
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:22,883
and then negative two,
that's a negative two,

205
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:24,126
as the Y component.

206
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:27,211
So the derivative vector should
look something like this.

207
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:29,772
Which means all corresponding
little DV nudges,

208
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:32,373
will be slight changes,

209
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:33,787
will be slight changes on that.

210
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,757
So these will be your, your DVs.

211
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:38,078
Something in that direction.

212
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:41,828
And what that means in
our vector field then,

213
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,752
as you move in the X direction

214
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:48,758
and consider the various
vectors attached to each point,

215
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:51,411
as you kind of passing
through the point one, two,

216
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:53,222
the way that the vectors are changing,

217
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,373
should be somehow down and to the right.

218
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:57,030
The tip should move down and to the right.

219
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,413
So if this starts highly
up and to the right,

220
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,184
then it should be getting kind of shorter,

221
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:02,706
but then longer to the right.

222
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:03,853
So then the V two,

223
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:06,382
if I were to have drawn
it more accurately here,

224
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,824
you know, what they nudged
output should look like,

225
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:11,602
it would really be
something that kind of like

226
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:12,535
I don't know, like this,

227
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:15,693
where it's getting shorter
in the Y direction,

228
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:17,829
but then longer in X direction,

229
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,886
as per that blue nudging arrow.

230
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:23,334
And then in the next video I'll kind of go

231
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:25,286
through more examples of
how you might think of this.

232
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:27,913
How you think of it in terms
of what each component means.

233
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:30,489
Which becomes very
important for later topics,

234
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,278
like divergence and curl.

235
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,643
And I'll see you next video.
