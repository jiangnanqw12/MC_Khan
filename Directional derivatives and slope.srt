00:00:00,115 --> 00:00:02,783
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone,
what I wanna talk about here

2
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:05,503
is how to interpret the
directional derivative

3
00:00:05,503 --> 00:00:07,079
in terms of graphs.

4
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:09,031
I have here the graph of a function,

5
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:11,051
a multivariable function,

6
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:14,884
it's f of xy is equal
to x squared times y.

7
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:18,804
In the last couple videos I talked

8
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:21,104
about what the directional derivative is,

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,404
how you can formally define it,

10
00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:24,404
how you can compute it using the gradient.

11
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:28,328
Generally the setup
that you might have is,

12
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,765
you have some kind of
vector, and this is a vector

13
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:33,108
in the input space so in this case

14
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:35,438
it's gonna be in the xy plane.

15
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:39,021
In this case I'll just
take the vector 1 1.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,580
Okay? And the directional
derivative, which we

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,764
denote by kind of taking
the gradient symbol,

18
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:50,060
except you stick the name of
that vector down in the lower

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,028
part there, the directional
derivative of your function,

20
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:56,376
it'll still take the same input.

21
00:00:56,376 --> 00:00:58,884
This is kind of a measure
of how the function changes

22
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:00,992
when the input moves in that direction.

23
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:03,844
So I'll show you what I mean, I mean

24
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:08,011
you could imagine slicing this
graph by some kind of plane

25
00:01:09,262 --> 00:01:11,701
but that plane doesn't
necessarily have to be parallel

26
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,513
to the x or y axes.

27
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:15,601
That's what we did for the
partial derivative, we took

28
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,945
a plane that represented
the constant x value or

29
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,990
the constant y value, but
this is gonna be a plane that

30
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,777
kind of tells you what
movement in the direction of

31
00:01:22,777 --> 00:01:25,657
your vector looks like, and
like I have a number of other

32
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:29,808
times I'm gonna go ahead and
slice the graph along that

33
00:01:29,808 --> 00:01:33,942
plane, and just to make it
clear, I'm gonna color in where

34
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:37,034
the graph intersects that slice.

35
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:39,914
This vector here, this little
v, you'll be thinking of it

36
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:44,418
as living on the xy plane and
it's determining the direction

37
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:47,066
of this plane that we're
slicing things with.

38
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,946
On the xy plane you've got this vector,

39
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:51,454
it's 1 1, it kind of points
to that diagonal direction,

40
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:54,848
and then you take the whole
plane and you slice your graph.

41
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:58,935
And if we want to interpret the
directional derivative here,

42
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:01,523
I'm gonna go ahead and
fill it an actual value,

43
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:04,856
so let's say we wanted to do it at -1 1,

44
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:08,054
- 1, -1

45
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:08,887
'cause I guess I chose a
plane that passes through the

46
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,958
origin, so I've got to
make sure that the point

47
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,046
I'm evaluating actually
goes along this plane,

48
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:16,370
but you could imagine one that
points in the same direction,

49
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,666
but you kind of slide it back and forth,

50
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:22,918
if we're doing this, we can
interpret this as a slope,

51
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:25,446
but you have to be very careful,
if you're gonna interpret

52
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:28,166
this as a slope, it has to be
the case that you're dealing

53
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,974
with a unit vector, that
the magnitude of your vector

54
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,830
is equal to 1.

55
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,526
I mean, it doesn't have to
be, you can kind of account

56
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,802
for it later but it makes
it more easy to think about.

57
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:39,126
If we're just thinking of a unit vector.

58
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,002
When I go over here instead
of saying that it's 1 1,

59
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:44,954
I'm gonna say it's whatever
vector points in the same

60
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:48,574
direction but has a unit
length, and in this case that

61
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:50,804
happens to be square root of 2 over 2,

62
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,312
for each of the components.

63
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:54,588
You can kind of think about
why that would be true

64
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:58,491
by diagonal but this is a
vector with unit length,

65
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:03,435
and its magnitude is 1, and
it points in that direction.

66
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:06,859
If we're evaluating this
negative point like 1 1,

67
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:09,192
we can draw that on the graph,
see where it actually is,

68
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:12,444
and in this case it'll be,
oops, moving things about when

69
00:03:12,444 --> 00:03:13,852
I had a point.

70
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:17,201
It'll be this point and if
you kinda look from above,

71
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,034
you see that's -1, -1,

72
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:22,964
and if we want the slope at that

73
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:25,704
point, you're kinda thinking
of the tangent line here.

74
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:27,840
Tangent line to that curve,
and we're wondering what its

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,276
slope is, so, the reason that
the directional derivative

76
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:36,876
is gonna give us this slope,
is because, another notation

77
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:39,012
that might be kinda helpful
for what this directional

78
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:42,949
derivative is, some people
will write partial f,

79
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:44,116
and partial v.

80
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:49,624
You can think about
that as taking a slight

81
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:53,504
nudge in the direction of
v, so this would be a little

82
00:03:53,504 --> 00:03:57,220
nudge, a little partial
nudge in the direction of v.

83
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,216
And then you're saying
"what changed in the value

84
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:02,604
of the function that's then resulting?"

85
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:04,556
"The height of the graph, does
it devalue the function?".

86
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:07,248
As this initial change
approaches zero and the resulting

87
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,688
change approaches zero as
well, that ratio, the ratio

88
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:14,144
of the partial f to partial
v, is going to give the slope

89
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:15,864
of this tangent line.

90
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:19,208
Conceptually, that's kind
of a nicer notation, but the

91
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,484
reason we use this other
notation is nabla sub v 1,

92
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:25,152
is it's very indicative
of how you compute things

93
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:27,439
once you need it computed.

94
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,559
You take the gradient of f,
just the vector value function

95
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:34,726
gradient of f, and take the
dot product with the vector.

96
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,429
Let's actually do that,
just to see what this would

97
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,797
look like, and I'll go ahead
and write it over here,

98
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:43,909
use a different color.

99
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:48,481
The gradient of f, first of
all, is a vector full of partial

100
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:52,757
derivatives, it'll be the
partial derivative of f with

101
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:56,425
respect to x and the partial
derivative of f with respect

102
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:57,258
to y.

103
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,065
When we actually evaluate
this, we take a look, partial

104
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:06,771
derivative of f with respect
to x, x looks like the variable

105
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:10,893
y I just a constant, so its
partial derivative is 2 times x

106
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,413
times y.

107
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,471
2 times x times y.

108
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:15,730
but when we take the partial with

109
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,597
respect to y, y now looks
like a variable, and x looks

110
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:21,637
like a constant, derivative of
a constant times a variable,

111
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:24,554
is just that constant x squared.

112
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:30,372
And if we were to evaluate
this at the point -1, -1,

113
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,539
then you can plug that in, 2
times -1 times -1 would be 2,

114
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:38,756
and then negative 1 squared, would be 1.

115
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:42,421
So that would be our gradient
at that point, which means

116
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:46,833
if we want to evaluate gradient
of f times v, we could go

117
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,829
over here, and say that's 2 1,

118
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:54,437
'cause we evaluate the gradient
at the point we care about.

119
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,091
And then the dot product,
with v itself in this case,

120
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,841
root 2 over 2, and root 2 over 2.

121
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,104
The answer that we get, we
multiply the fist two components

122
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:11,124
together, 2 times root 2
over 2, then square it to 2,

123
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:14,280
and then here we multiply the
second components together,

124
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,047
and that's gonna be 1 times
root 2 over 2, root 2 over 2,

125
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,248
and that would be our answer,
that would be our slope.

126
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:25,404
But this only works if your
vector is a unit vector,

127
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:27,656
and I showed this in the last
video where we talked about

128
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:30,860
the formal definition of
the directional derivative.

129
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,088
If you scale v by 2, and I
can do it here if instead of v

130
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:37,084
you're talking about 2 v, so
I'll go ahead and make myself

131
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:38,334
some room here.

132
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:48,556
If you're taking the
directional derivative along 2 v

133
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:51,690
of f, the way that we're
computing that, we're still taking

134
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,857
the gradient of f, dot product
with 2 times your vector,

135
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:00,069
and dot product, you
can pull out that too.

136
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,597
This is just gonna double the
value of the entire thing.

137
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:08,825
V, this started with v, it's
gonna be twice the value,

138
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:11,193
the derivative will become
twice the value, but you don't

139
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:13,397
necessarily want that because
you'd see this plane you

140
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:16,809
sliced with, if instead of
doing it in the direction of v,

141
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:20,085
the unit vector, you did in
the direction of 2 times v,

142
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,893
it's the same plane, it's
the same slice you're taking,

143
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:24,893
and you'd want that same
slope, so that's gonna mess

144
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:25,749
everything up.

145
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,793
This is super important if
you're thinking about things in

146
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:30,311
the context of slope, one
thing that you could say is

147
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:34,433
your formula for the slope of
a graph in the direction of v,

148
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,593
is you take your directional
derivative, that dot product

149
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:40,751
between f and v, and you just
always make sure to divide it

150
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,955
by the magnitude of v,
divide it by that magnitude.

151
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:47,555
That will always take care
of what you want, that's

152
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:49,599
basically a way of making sure
that really, you're taking

153
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,827
the directional derivative
in the direction of a certain

154
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:52,987
unit vector.

155
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:56,307
Some people even go so far
as to define the directional

156
00:07:56,307 --> 00:08:00,487
derivative to be this, to be
something where you normalize

157
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:02,255
out the length of that vector.

158
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:06,179
I don't really like that, but
I think that's because they're

159
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:10,147
thinking of the slope context,
they're thinking of rates of

160
00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:12,747
change as being the slope of a graph.

161
00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:15,559
One thing I'd like to
emphasize as always, graphical

162
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:18,903
intuition is good, and visual
intuition is always great,

163
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:21,039
you should always be trying
to find a way to think about

164
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,919
things visually, but with
multivariable functions,

165
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,659
the graph isn't the only way.

166
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,537
You can kind of more generally
think about just a nudge

167
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:31,857
in the v direction, and in
the context where v doesn't

168
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:35,085
have a length 1, the nudge
doesn't represent an actual size

169
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:39,284
but it's a certain scaling
constant times that vector,

170
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,164
you can look at the video on
the formal definition for the

171
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:43,788
directional derivative, if
you want more details on that.

172
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:46,460
But I do think this is actually
a good way to get a feel for

173
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,923
what the directional
derivative is all about.
