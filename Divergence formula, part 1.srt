00:00:01,054 --> 00:00:01,887
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:02,979
So now that we have an intuition

3
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:05,044
for what divergence is
trying to represent,

4
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:07,454
let's start actually
drilling in on a formula.

5
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:08,713
The first thing I want to do

6
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:11,665
is just limit our perspective to functions

7
00:00:11,665 --> 00:00:13,927
that only have an X component, or rather,

8
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:18,010
where the Y component of
the output is just zero.

9
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,004
So this is some kind of vector field

10
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:22,341
and if there's only an X component

11
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:23,838
what this means it's going to look like

12
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:26,294
is all of the vectors
only go left or right,

13
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:30,595
and there's kind of no up or
down involved in any of them.

14
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:32,935
So in this case, let's
start thinking about what

15
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:35,800
positive divergence of your vector fields

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
might look like near some point X-Y.

17
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:41,323
So if you have your point,

18
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:44,847
this is that point X-Y sitting
off somewhere in space,

19
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:48,159
two cases where the divergence
of this might look positive

20
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,052
are, one, where nothing
happens at the point.

21
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:55,219
So in this case P would be
equal to zero at our point.

22
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:59,095
But then to left of it things
are moving to the left,

23
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:02,773
meaning P, the X component of
our vector valued function,

24
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:03,773
is negative.

25
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:07,863
That's why the X component
of this vector is negative.

26
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:10,148
But then to the right,

27
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:11,982
vectors would be moving off to the right.

28
00:01:11,982 --> 00:01:14,679
So over here, P would be positive.

29
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:16,682
So this would be an example of a

30
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:18,432
positive divergence circumstance

31
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:20,922
where only the X component is responsible.

32
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:21,755
And what you'll notice here,

33
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:23,290
this would be P starts negative,

34
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,515
goes zero, then becomes positive.

35
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:27,669
So as you're changing in the X direction,

36
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:29,591
P should be increasing.

37
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:33,655
So a positive divergence
here seems to correspond to

38
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:37,988
a positive partial derivative
of P with respect to X.

39
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:39,363
And if that seems a little unfamiliar,

40
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:41,746
if you're not sure how to
think about partial derivatives

41
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:44,563
of a component of a vector field,

42
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,904
I have a video on that
and you can take a look

43
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:48,735
and refresh yourself, how
you might think about this

44
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:51,011
partial derivative of P with respect to X.

45
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,436
And once you do, hopefully it makes sense

46
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:55,078
why this specific positive
divergence example

47
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,515
corresponds with the positive
partial derivative of P.

48
00:01:58,515 --> 00:01:59,646
But remember, this isn't the only way

49
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:01,184
that a positive divergence might look.

50
00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:05,351
You're gonna have another
circumstance where, let's say,

51
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:09,731
your point, X-Y,

52
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:11,208
actually has a vector attached to it.

53
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,875
So this here again
represents our point X-Y.

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,794
And in this specific example
this would be P is positive.

55
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:22,223
P of X-Y is positive at your point there.

56
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:24,452
But another way that positive
divergence might look

57
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:27,433
is that you have things
coming in towards that point

58
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:30,034
and things going away,
but the things going away

59
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,729
are bigger than the ones coming in.

60
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:35,189
But again, this exhibits the
idea of P increasing in value.

61
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,434
P starts off small, it's a
positive but small component,

62
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:40,822
and then it gets bigger and
then it gets even bigger.

63
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:42,944
So once again we have this idea of

64
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:45,661
positive partial derivative
of P with respect to X,

65
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:47,054
because changes in X,

66
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:49,443
as you increase X it
causes an increase in P,

67
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:52,066
seems to correspond to
positive divergence.

68
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:54,226
And you can even look at
it if you go the other way

69
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:58,336
where you have a little bit of
negative component to P here.

70
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:00,495
So P is a little bit negative,

71
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:03,375
but to the left of your
point it's really negative,

72
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,207
and then to the right it's
not nearly as negative.

73
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:07,670
And in this case it's kind of like

74
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,364
as you're moving to the
right, as X is increasing,

75
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,105
you start off very negative,

76
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:13,490
and then only kind of negative,

77
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,054
and then barely negative.

78
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:17,341
And once again that
corresponds to an increase

79
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:20,491
in the value of P as X increases.

80
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,501
So what you'd expect is that
a partial derivative of P,

81
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:26,684
that X component of the
output, with respect to X,

82
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:28,785
is gonna be somewhere
involved in the formula

83
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:33,000
for the divergence of our
vector field at a point X-Y.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,420
In the next video I'm gonna
go a similar line of reasoning

85
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,846
to see what should go on
with that Y component.
