00:00:00,796 --> 00:00:02,868
- [Voiceover] Hello
everyone, so in this video

2
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:05,083
I'm gonna introduce vector fields.

3
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,769
Now these are a concept
that come up all the time

4
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:09,288
in multi variable calculus,
and that's probably because

5
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:11,726
they come up all the time in physics.

6
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:14,429
It comes up with fluid
flow, with electrodynamics,

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,176
you see them all over the place.

8
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:18,594
And what a vector field is,
is its pretty much a way

9
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:22,231
of visualizing functions
that have the same number

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,481
of dimensions in their
input as in their output.

11
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,996
So here I'm gonna write a function

12
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:28,366
that's got a two dimensional input

13
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:30,154
X and Y, and then its output

14
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:33,100
is going to be a two dimensional vector

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,148
and each of the components
will somehow depend on X and Y.

16
00:00:36,148 --> 00:00:39,571
I'll make the first one
Y cubed minus nine Y

17
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:42,853
and then the second component,
the Y component of the output

18
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:45,738
will be X cubed minus nine X.

19
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:48,237
I made them symmetric here,
looking kind of similar

20
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:52,077
they don't have to be, I'm
just a sucker for symmetry.

21
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:54,412
So if you imagine trying to
visualize a function like this

22
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:57,412
with a graph it would be really hard

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,084
because you have two
dimensions in the input

24
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:02,646
two dimensions in the output

25
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,891
so you'd have to somehow

26
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:06,441
visualize this thing in four dimensions.

27
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,022
So instead what we do, we
look only in the input space.

28
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:11,460
So that means we look
only in the X,Y plane.

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,207
So I'll draw these coordinate axes

30
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,356
and just mark it up,
this here's our X axis

31
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:17,880
this here's our Y axis

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,188
and for each individual input point

33
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:22,938
like lets say one,two

34
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:26,308
so lets say we go to one,two

35
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,062
I'm gonna consider the
vector that it outputs

36
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:34,297
and attach that vector to the point.

37
00:01:34,297 --> 00:01:36,247
So lets walk through an
example of what I mean by that

38
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:39,497
so if we actually evaluate F at one,two

39
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:43,971
X is equal to one Y is equal to two

40
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,904
so we plug in two cubed

41
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:47,321
whoops, two cubed

42
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:50,870
minus nine times two

43
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,151
up here in the X component

44
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:56,326
and then one cubed minus nine times Y

45
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:58,849
nine times one, excuse me

46
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:01,583
down in the Y component.

47
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,346
Two cubed is eight nine times two is 18

48
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:07,013
so eight minus 18 is negative 10

49
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,393
negative 10

50
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:13,509
and then one cubed is one,
nine times one is nine

51
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,509
so one minus nine is negative eight.

52
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:21,128
Now first imagine that this was

53
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:22,896
if we just drew this vector where we count

54
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:25,497
starting from the origin,
negative one, two,

55
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:29,316
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10,

56
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,226
so its going to have
this as its X component

57
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:33,055
and then negative eight,
one, two, three, four,

58
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:36,712
five, six, seven, we're gonna
actually go off the screen

59
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:38,012
its a very very large vector

60
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:39,370
so its gonna be something here

61
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,324
and it ends up having
to go off the screen.

62
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:42,380
But the nice thing about vectors

63
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,229
it doesn't matter where they start

64
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:46,688
so instead we can start it
here and we still want it

65
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:49,573
to have that negative ten X component

66
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:51,300
and the negative eight, negative one, two,

67
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,383
three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

68
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,141
negative eight

69
00:02:58,457 --> 00:03:00,457
as its Y component there

70
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:04,770
and a plan with the vector field

71
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,086
is to do this at not just one,two

72
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,732
but at a whole bunch of different points

73
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:10,825
and see what vectors attach to them

74
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:12,674
and if we drew them all
according to their size

75
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:14,015
this would be a real mess.

76
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:16,067
There'd be markings all over the place

77
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:19,744
and this one might have some
huge vector attached to it

78
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:22,182
and this one would have some
huge vector attached to it

79
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:24,377
and it would get really really messy.

80
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:28,544
But instead what we do, just
gonna clear up the board here

81
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:32,077
we scale them down, this is common

82
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:34,820
you'll scale them down and
so that you're kind of lying

83
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,705
about what the vectors themselves are

84
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:39,493
but you get a much better feel for

85
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:42,073
what each thing corresponds to.

86
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:43,414
And another thing about this drawing

87
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:45,222
that's not entirely faithful

88
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:47,620
to the original function that we have

89
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,139
is that all of these
vectors are the same length.

90
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:51,886
I made this one just kind of the same unit

91
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:53,878
this one the same unit, and over here

92
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:55,279
they all just have the same length

93
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:57,839
even though in reality
the length of the vectors'

94
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:01,029
output by this function
can be wildly different.

95
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:03,630
This is kind of common practice
when vector fields are drawn

96
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,515
or when some kind of software
is drawing them for you

97
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,872
so there are ways of getting around this

98
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:11,472
one way is to just use
colors with your vectors

99
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:15,272
so I'll switch over to a
different vector field here

100
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:17,994
and here color is used to
kind of give a hint of length

101
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:19,721
so it still looks organized
because all of them

102
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:23,541
have the same length but the difference

103
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:27,239
is that red and warmer
colors are supposed to

104
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,799
indicate this is a very
long vector somehow

105
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:32,176
and then blue would indicate
that its very short.

106
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:34,655
Another thing you can
do is scale them to be

107
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:37,235
roughly proportional
to what they should be

108
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,515
so notice all the blue vectors

109
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:40,384
scaled way down to basically be zero

110
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:42,700
red vectors kind of stay the same size

111
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,834
even though in reality this
might be representing a function

112
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,353
where the true vector
here should be really long

113
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,933
or the true vector should
be kind of medium length

114
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,742
its still common for people
to just shrink them down

115
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:54,139
so its a reasonable thing to view.

116
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,638
So in the next video I'm
gonna talk about fluid flow

117
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,365
a context in which vector
fields come up all the time

118
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:01,169
and its also a pretty
good way to get a feel for

119
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:02,693
a random vector field that you look at

120
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:04,665
to understand what its all about.
