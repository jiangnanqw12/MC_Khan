00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:01,284
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,284 --> 00:00:04,458
So here, I'd like to talk
about harmonic functions.

3
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:05,803
Now, harmonic functions

4
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:06,754
are a very special kind

5
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:08,864
of multivariable function,

6
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:10,710
and they're defined in
terms of the Laplacian,

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,610
which I've been talking about

8
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,969
in the last few videos.

9
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:14,470
So the Laplacian, which we denote

10
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,104
with this upper right-side-up triangle,

11
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:20,110
is an operator that you might take

12
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,625
on a multivariable function.

13
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,693
So it might have two inputs,

14
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,573
it could have, you know, a hundred inputs,

15
00:00:24,573 --> 00:00:26,350
just some kind of multivariable function

16
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,906
with a scalar output.

17
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,447
And I talked about it
in the last few videos,

18
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,280
but as a reminder,

19
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,463
it's defined as the divergence

20
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:33,213
of the gradient of F,

21
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:36,631
and it's kind of like
the second derivative.

22
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,223
It's sort of the way to extend the idea

23
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:39,581
of the second derivative

24
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,282
into multiple dimensions.

25
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:43,102
Now, what a harmonic function is,

26
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:46,558
is one where the Laplacian
is equal to zero.

27
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:47,391
And it's equal to zero

28
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:49,328
at every possible input point.

29
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:50,989
And sometimes the way that people

30
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:52,311
write this to distinguish it,

31
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:54,414
they'll make a kind of triple equals sign,

32
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:56,235
maybe saying like, "Equivalent to zero."

33
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:58,300
And this is really just
a way of emphasizing

34
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,719
that it's equal to zero

35
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,915
at all possible input points.

36
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:02,352
It's, you know, not an equation

37
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:04,149
that you're solving for
the specific X and Y,

38
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,313
where it equals zero.

39
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:07,078
It's a statement about the function.

40
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:08,682
And to get our head around this,

41
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:10,078
because it's kind of a,

42
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:10,932
you know, as you're just starting

43
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:12,517
to learn about the Laplacian,

44
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:13,359
it's hard to just immediately

45
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,754
see the intuition for what this means,

46
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:16,587
let's think about what it means

47
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:18,338
for a single variable function.

48
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:21,474
If you just have some single
variable function of X,

49
00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:22,962
and you're looking at
its second derivative,

50
00:01:22,962 --> 00:01:25,417
which is kind of the
analog of the Laplacian,

51
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:27,498
what does it mean if that's equal to zero?

52
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:29,094
Well, we can integrate it,

53
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:30,661
we can take the antiderivative,

54
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:34,526
and say, that means that
the single derivative of F,

55
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:35,383
well let's see, what functions

56
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:37,372
have a derivative that's zero?

57
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:39,173
The only functions are the constant ones,

58
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:41,564
so C is just gonna mean
some constant here.

59
00:01:41,564 --> 00:01:42,808
And if you integrate that again,

60
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:44,164
say what function has,

61
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:46,241
as its derivative, a constant,

62
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:48,743
well, it's gonna be that constant times X,

63
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:50,097
plus some other constant,

64
00:01:50,097 --> 00:01:51,985
some other constant K.

65
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:53,663
So basically, linear functions.

66
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:54,924
So if you're thinking of a graph,

67
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:56,972
it's just something that's got a line,

68
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,566
line passing through it like that.

69
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,116
And this should kind of make sense

70
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:01,872
if you think of the
geometric interpretation

71
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,500
for the second derivative.

72
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,658
Because if you're just
looking at a random,

73
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:06,851
you know, arbitrary function

74
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:08,468
that's kind of curving as it does,

75
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:11,128
the second derivative is negative

76
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:12,762
when this concavity is down.

77
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:14,374
So this right here would be a point

78
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:15,391
where the second derivative,

79
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,950
it's not zero, it's negative.

80
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,823
And over here, when the concavity is up,

81
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:20,780
and it's got a sort of bowl shape,

82
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,177
that's where the second
derivative is positive.

83
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,509
So if we're saying that
the second derivative

84
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:27,063
has to always be zero,

85
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,437
then it can't curve down
and it can't curve up,

86
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:30,997
and it can't do that anywhere,

87
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:33,023
so basically there's no curving allowed,

88
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:35,294
so whatever direction it starts at,

89
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:36,456
it's not allowed to curve,

90
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,295
so it just sticks straight like that.

91
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:40,850
But once we extend this to the idea

92
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,567
of a multivariable function,

93
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,901
things can get a lot more interesting

94
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,443
than just a straight line.

95
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:46,428
So an example,

96
00:02:46,428 --> 00:02:47,660
I've got the graph here

97
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,886
of a multivariable function

98
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:51,720
that happens to be harmonic.

99
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,813
So the graph that you're looking at,

100
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:54,818
this is of a two variable function,

101
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:58,248
and the function specifically is

102
00:02:58,248 --> 00:02:59,081
F of XY,

103
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:01,622
XY,

104
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:04,001
is equal to E to the X

105
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,362
multiplied by

106
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:06,195
sine of Y.

107
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,210
And as we're looking at the graph here,

108
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,427
hopefully it makes a little bit of sense

109
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:13,033
why this is sort of an E to the X

110
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,790
sine of Y pattern.

111
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,837
'Cause as we're moving in
the positive X direction,

112
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:18,485
this here is the positive X direction,

113
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:20,284
you have this exponential shape,

114
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,245
and this corresponds with
the fact that over here

115
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,857
we've got an E to the X,

116
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:24,718
so as you move X,

117
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,170
it kinda looks like E to the X,

118
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,688
and it's being multiplied by something

119
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:29,052
that is a function of Y.

120
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,302
So if you're holding Y constant,

121
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:31,858
this just looks like a constant.

122
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:32,813
But notice, if that was a,

123
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:33,952
if that was a negative constant,

124
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,279
if sine of Y at some point

125
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,631
happens to be negative,

126
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:38,548
then your whole exponential function

127
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:39,796
actually kind of goes down.

128
00:03:39,796 --> 00:03:41,919
It's sort of like a
negative E to the X look.

129
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,088
But if you imagine moving
in the Y direction,

130
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:46,803
so instead of the pure
X direction like that,

131
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:49,669
if we imagine ourselves moving

132
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,155
with the input going along,

133
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:51,988
let's see what it would be,

134
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:53,110
it would be this way,

135
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,814
positive Y direction,

136
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:57,120
you have this sort of sinusoidal shape,

137
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,249
and that should make sense

138
00:03:58,249 --> 00:03:59,635
because you've got this sine of Y.

139
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:01,401
And depending on what E to the X is,

140
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,201
the amplitude of that sine wave

141
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,059
is gonna get, you know,

142
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:05,339
really high at some points here.

143
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:07,016
It's going way up and way down.

144
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,249
But if E to the X was
really small, you know,

145
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,579
it hardly, hardly even looks

146
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:11,703
like it's wiggling over here.

147
00:04:11,703 --> 00:04:13,916
It pretty much looks flat.

148
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,824
So that's the graph that we're looking at.

149
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:16,657
And I'm telling you right now,

150
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,105
I claim that this is harmonic.

151
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:19,882
This is a function whose Laplacian

152
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:21,207
is equal to zero.

153
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:23,039
And what that would mean is that

154
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,790
as we go over here and we say,

155
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,839
we evaluate the Laplacian of F,

156
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,110
which, just to remind you,

157
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,115
there's a different formula

158
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:31,984
rather than thinking
divergence of gradient,

159
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:33,685
that turns out to be completely the same

160
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:35,845
as saying, you take the second derivative

161
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:38,434
of that function with respect to X,

162
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:39,859
that's its first input,

163
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,324
and you add that,

164
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,850
let's see, second derivative
with respect to X,

165
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,111
you add that to the second derivative

166
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:46,288
of your function

167
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:47,825
with respect to the next variable.

168
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:48,658
And you keep doing this

169
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:49,995
for all of the different
variables that there are,

170
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:51,898
but this is just a two variable function,

171
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:53,253
so you do this twice.

172
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:54,652
The claim is that this

173
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,010
is always equal to zero.

174
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,352
So I might say, kind of equivalent,

175
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:58,867
at every possible input,

176
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,733
it's equal to zero.

177
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:01,566
And I think I'll leave that

178
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:03,134
as something for you to compute.

179
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:04,255
It might be kind of good practice

180
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:05,960
to kind of get a feel for

181
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,423
computing the Laplacian.

182
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:08,587
But what I wanna do is interpret

183
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:09,992
what does this actually mean, right?

184
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:11,068
'Cause you can plug it through,

185
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:11,901
and you can see, ah yes,

186
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:13,801
at all possible inputs, it will be zero.

187
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:14,920
But what does that mean?

188
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,004
Because in the single variable context,

189
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:18,740
once we started thinking about

190
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,569
the geometric interpretation

191
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,882
of a second derivative as this concavity,

192
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:23,871
it sort of made sense

193
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:25,033
that forcing it to be zero

194
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,514
will give us a straight line.

195
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:27,570
But clearly, that's not the case.

196
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,701
This is much more complicated

197
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,269
than a straight line.

198
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,102
And for that,

199
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:32,651
I want to give a kind of a different

200
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:33,933
way that you can think about

201
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,235
the single variable second derivative.

202
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,476
On the one hand, you can think of,

203
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:39,553
let's say, negative second derivative,

204
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:40,752
as being this concavity

205
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:42,467
where it's kind of frowning down.

206
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,279
But another way you can
maybe think about this

207
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,586
is saying that all of the
neighbors of your point,

208
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:48,339
if you go a little bit to the left, right,

209
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,736
you've got an input point here,

210
00:05:49,736 --> 00:05:51,195
and if you go a little bit to the left,

211
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:52,872
the neighbor is less than it,

212
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:54,168
and if you go a little bit to the right,

213
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:56,126
that other neighbor is also less than it.

214
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:57,917
So it's kind of a way of saying,

215
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,089
hey, if you look at the
neighbors of your input,

216
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,926
so if you, if you happen
to be making the claim

217
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:04,906
that F double prime, at
some particular input,

218
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,192
like X sub O,

219
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:07,766
is less than zero,

220
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,281
it's saying that all of the neighbors

221
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:10,349
of X sub O,

222
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:11,631
all of the neighbors of that point,

223
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:13,022
are less than it.

224
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:13,974
And if you do a similar thing

225
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,873
over at a positive concavity point

226
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:17,536
where it's kind of smiling up,

227
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:19,286
you say, well its neighbor to the right

228
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:20,200
has a greater value,

229
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,376
and its neighbor to the
left has a greater value.

230
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:25,035
So at some point, where
the second derivative,

231
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:27,004
instead of being less than zero,

232
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:28,171
happens to be,

233
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,826
happens to be greater than zero,

234
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:32,162
that means that the neighbors

235
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:34,376
tend to be greater than the point itself.

236
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:35,946
And even if you're
looking at a circumstance

237
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:37,572
that isn't this idealized, you know,

238
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:39,340
it happens to be a local minimum,

239
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,723
but let's say you're looking at a graph.

240
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:44,199
Let's say you're looking at a function

241
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,248
at a point where it's concave up, right?

242
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:49,710
It's concave up, but
it's not this idealized,

243
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,388
local minimum kind of circumstance.

244
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:52,371
So instead, you might be looking

245
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,401
at a point like this,

246
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:54,284
and if you look at, you know,

247
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:55,666
its neighbor to the left,

248
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,545
that'll have some value
that's actually less

249
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:58,697
than your original guy,

250
00:06:58,697 --> 00:06:59,611
so the neighbor looks like

251
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,044
it's less than it on the left,

252
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,151
but if you move that same
distance to the right,

253
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:05,076
its neighbor is greater.

254
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:06,398
But you would say, on average,

255
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:08,669
if you took the average
value of the neighbors,

256
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,565
the neighbor on the
right kind of outbalances

257
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:11,672
the neighbor on the left,

258
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:13,022
and you would say, on average,

259
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:15,815
its neighbors are greater
than the point itself.

260
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,445
So let's say that input point there

261
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:18,679
was like X sub O,

262
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,476
that would mean that the second derivative

263
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:22,926
of your function at that point,

264
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:24,899
you know, is greater than zero.

265
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:26,236
So this positive concavity,

266
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:27,185
you can also think of it

267
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:29,009
as a measure of, on average,

268
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,206
are the neighbors greater
than your original point

269
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:32,350
or less than it?

270
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,205
And the reason I'm saying this

271
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:35,186
is because this idea,

272
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,583
of kind of comparing your neighbors

273
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,705
to the original point

274
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:39,958
is a much better way to contemplate

275
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,360
the Laplacian in the multivariable world.

276
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,833
So if we look at a function like this,

277
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,114
and let's say we're looking at it

278
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:47,687
kind of from a bird's eye view.

279
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:49,771
So we've got our XY plane, right?

280
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:51,632
This over here is the X-axis,

281
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:54,012
and this up here is the Y-axis.

282
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:54,845
And let's say that we're looking

283
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:57,253
at some specific input point.

284
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:58,326
With the Laplacian,

285
00:07:58,326 --> 00:07:59,508
you wanna start thinking about

286
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:00,806
a circle of points around it,

287
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:01,827
all of its neighbors,

288
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:03,306
and in fact, think of a perfect circle,

289
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:04,139
so all of the points

290
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,984
that are a specified distance away.

291
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:08,151
The question the Laplacian is asking is,

292
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:10,582
"Hey, are those neighbor
points, on average,

293
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:13,697
"greater than or less
than your original point?"

294
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:14,530
And this is actually,

295
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,081
this is how I introduced the Laplacian

296
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,886
in the original video where I was giving

297
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:20,580
kind of the intuition for the Laplacian,

298
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,536
you're asking, "Do the
points around a given input

299
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,061
"happen to be greater
than it or less than it?"

300
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,170
And if you're looking at a point

301
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,902
where the Laplacian of your function

302
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:32,930
happens to be greater
than zero at some point,

303
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,623
that would mean all of the neighbors

304
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:37,298
tend to be, on average,
greater than your point.

305
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:38,569
Whereas if you're looking at a point

306
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:40,108
where the Laplacian of your function

307
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:41,435
is less than zero,

308
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:43,006
then all of those neighbors, on average,

309
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,343
would be less than your point.

310
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:45,431
So in particular, you know,

311
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:47,263
if the Laplacian was less than zero,

312
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:50,125
your point might look
like a local maximum.

313
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,581
Or if the Laplacian was greater than zero,

314
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:53,015
it might look like a local minimum,

315
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:53,848
'cause all of its neighbors

316
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:55,531
would be greater than where it is.

317
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,554
But for harmonic functions,

318
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:58,247
what makes them so special

319
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,716
is that you're saying

320
00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:01,832
the value of the function itself,

321
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,816
or the value of the
Laplacian of the function

322
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:05,286
at every possible point

323
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:06,679
is equal to zero.

324
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,173
So no matter what point you choose,

325
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,451
those neighbors are gonna be,

326
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:12,070
on average, the same value as this guy.

327
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,074
So the height of the graph
above those neighbors

328
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,615
will, on average, be the same.

329
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:17,204
So,

330
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:18,786
so if we kind of look around the graph,

331
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:20,315
what that should mean is,

332
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:22,058
let's say you're looking
at an input point,

333
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:24,144
you know, the output of this guy.

334
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:25,461
And if we looked at all of its,

335
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:26,460
the circle of its neighbors,

336
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,711
and kind of projected
them up onto the graph,

337
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:29,962
what it should mean is that the height

338
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:31,435
of all the points on this circle,

339
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:32,954
on average, are the same as that.

340
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:34,152
And no matter where you look,

341
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:35,877
that should kind of average out.

342
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:37,493
And again, I encourage you to

343
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,393
take a look at,

344
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:39,309
take a look at this function

345
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:40,606
and actually evaluate the Laplacian

346
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:41,712
to see that it's zero.

347
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:44,173
But what's interesting
is it's not at all clear,

348
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:45,190
just looking at this E to the X

349
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,898
times sine of Y formula,

350
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:49,895
that the average value of
a circle of input points

351
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:51,690
is always gonna kind of equal the value

352
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,006
of the point at the center.

353
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:54,485
That's not something you can easily tell

354
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:56,040
just looking at that formula.

355
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,217
But with what's not
that hard a computation,

356
00:09:58,217 --> 00:09:59,533
you can make this conclusion,

357
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:00,803
which is pretty far-reaching.

358
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:02,816
And this comes up all the time in physics.

359
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:04,594
You know, for example, heat is one

360
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:05,987
where maybe you wanna describe

361
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:08,765
how the heat at a certain point in a room

362
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,927
is related to the
average value of the heat

363
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,806
of all of the points kind of around it.

364
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:14,856
And in fact, it comes up in
all sorts of circumstances

365
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:17,032
where you have some
point in physical space

366
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:18,336
and something about that point,

367
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:19,599
maybe like the rate at which

368
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,276
some property of it is changing

369
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:23,334
corresponds to the average value

370
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:24,643
at points around it.

371
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:26,577
So whenever you're sort
of relating neighbors

372
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:28,787
to your original point,
the Laplacian comes in,

373
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:30,558
and harmonic functions have this tendency

374
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:32,670
to correspond to some notion of stability.

375
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,244
And I won't go deeper into that now.

376
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:35,531
This is really,

377
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:36,742
that really starts to get into the topic

378
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:38,651
of partial differential equations.

379
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:39,921
But at least in the context of

380
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,324
just multivariable calculus,

381
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:42,660
I wanted to shed some light

382
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,836
on interpreting this operator,

383
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:45,669
and kind of interpreting

384
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:48,340
the physical and geometric properties

385
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,034
that that implies about a function.

386
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:52,124
And with that,

387
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:54,291
I will see you next video.
