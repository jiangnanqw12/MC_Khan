1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:02,330
- [Voiceover] When you have
a multivariable function,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,964
something that takes in
multiple different input values

3
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:07,098
and let's say it's just
outputting a single number,

4
00:00:07,098 --> 00:00:08,284
a very common thing you wanna do

5
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:11,871
with an animal like this is Maximize it.

6
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:13,941
Maximize it, and what this means

7
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:15,615
is you're looking for the input points,

8
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,317
the values of x and y and
all of its other inputs,

9
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:22,666
such that the output, f, is as
great as it possibly can be.

10
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,725
Now this actually comes up
all the time in practice

11
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:25,671
'cause usually when you're dealing

12
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:28,226
with a multivariable function,
it's not just for fun

13
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:29,949
and for dealing with abstract symbols,

14
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,370
it's 'cause it actually
represents something,

15
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,590
so maybe it represents
profits of a company,

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,664
maybe this is a function
where you're considering

17
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:37,737
all the choices you can make,

18
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,368
like the wages you give your employees

19
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:41,036
or the prices of your goods,

20
00:00:41,036 --> 00:00:43,420
or the amount of debt that
you raise for capital,

21
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,470
all sorts of choices that you might make,

22
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,362
and you wanna know what
values should you give

23
00:00:47,362 --> 00:00:50,202
to those choices such
that you maximize profits,

24
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:52,272
you maximize the thing,
and if you have a function

25
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:53,917
that models these relationships,

26
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:56,058
there are techniques, which
I'm about to teach you,

27
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,777
that you can use to maximize this.

28
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:59,031
Another very common setting,

29
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:00,462
more and more important these days,

30
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:03,127
is that of machine learning
and artificial intelligence,

31
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:05,332
where often what you do
is you assign something

32
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,915
called a cost function to a task,

33
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:09,408
so maybe you're trying to teach a computer

34
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:13,533
how to understand audio or
how to read handwritten text.

35
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,262
What you do, is you find a function

36
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:17,773
that basically tells it how wrong it is

37
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:20,247
when it makes a guess,
and if you do a good job

38
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,997
designing that function, you
just need to tell the computer

39
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:25,769
to Minimize, so that's kind
of the flip side, right?

40
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,003
Instead of finding the maximum,

41
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,869
to minimize a certain function,

42
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:31,783
and if it minimizes this cost function,

43
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:34,057
that means that it's
doing a really good job

44
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:35,775
at whatever task you've assigned it,

45
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:38,524
so a lot of the art and
science of machine learning

46
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:41,125
and artificial intelligence
comes down to, well,

47
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,682
one finding this cost function

48
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:45,293
and actually describing difficult tasks

49
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:47,978
in terms of a function, but
then applying the techniques

50
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:49,102
that I'm about to teach you

51
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:50,976
to have the computer minimize that,

52
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:51,980
and a lot of time and research

53
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,529
has gone into figuring out
ways to basically apply

54
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:57,489
these techniques, but really
quickly and efficiently.

55
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,647
So, first of all, on a conceptual level,

56
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:00,923
let's just think about what it means

57
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:04,228
to be finding the maximum
of a multivariable function.

58
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:06,535
So I have here the graph
of a two-variable function.

59
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:08,747
It's something that has
a two-variable input

60
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:10,645
that we're thinking of as the xy-plane,

61
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:13,294
and then its output is
the height of this graph,

62
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:14,995
and if you're looking to maximize it,

63
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:17,703
basically, what you're
finding is this peak,

64
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:20,486
kind of the tallest
mountain in the entire area,

65
00:02:20,486 --> 00:02:21,938
and you're looking for the input value,

66
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:25,685
the point on the xy-plane
directly below that peak,

67
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:27,471
'cause that tells you
the values of the inputs

68
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:30,006
that you should put in to
maximize your function,

69
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:32,049
so how do you go about finding that?

70
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,804
Well, this is perhaps the core observation

71
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:37,436
in well, calculus, not just
multivariable calculus.

72
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:39,361
This is similar in the
single variable world,

73
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:41,055
and there are similarities
in other settings,

74
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:42,744
but the core observation

75
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:45,463
is that if you take a
tangent plane at that peak,

76
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:48,588
so let's just draw in a
tangent plane at that peak,

77
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:50,524
it's gonna be completely flat,

78
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,633
but let's say you did this
at a different point, right?

79
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,036
'Cause if you tried to
find the tangent plane,

80
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:57,312
not at that point, but you
kind of moved it about a bit

81
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:59,796
to somewhere that's not quite a maximum,

82
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:02,666
if the tangent plane has
any kind of slope to it,

83
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,169
what that's telling
you is that if you take

84
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,765
very small directions,

85
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:08,264
kind of in the direction
of that upward slope,

86
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:10,247
you can increase the
value of your function,

87
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:12,330
so if there's any slope
to the tangent plane,

88
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,761
you know that you can walk in
some direction to increase it,

89
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,480
but if there's no slope
to it, if it's flat,

90
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,231
then that's a sign that no
matter which direction you walk,

91
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,353
you're not gonna be significantly
increasing the value

92
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:23,734
of your function.

93
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:26,647
So what does this mean
in terms of formulas?

94
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,228
Well, if you kind of think back

95
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:29,736
to how we compute tangent planes

96
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,001
and if you're not very
comfortable with that,

97
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,928
now would be a good time
to take another look

98
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:35,195
at those videos about tangent planes,

99
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:37,695
the slope of the plane in each direction,

100
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:40,057
so this would be the
slope in the x direction,

101
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:41,936
and then if you look at it
from another perspective,

102
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:43,852
this would be the slope
in the y direction,

103
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:46,264
each one of those has
to be zero, and that,

104
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:48,037
in terms of partial derivatives,

105
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:50,700
means the partial
derivative of your function,

106
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,156
at whatever point you're
dealing with, right?

107
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:55,591
So I'll call it x not, y not, as the point

108
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,170
where you're inputting
this, has to be zero,

109
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,273
and then similarly, the partial derivative

110
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,261
with respect to the other
variable, with respect to y,

111
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:06,178
at that same point, has to be zero,

112
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,668
and both of these have to be true

113
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:11,065
because let's just take
a look, I don't know,

114
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:13,511
let's slide it over a little bit here,

115
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:15,761
this tangent plane, if
you look at the slope,

116
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:18,147
you imagine walking in the y direction,

117
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:19,772
you're not increasing your value at all.

118
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:22,600
The slope in the y direction
would actually be zero,

119
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,342
so that would mean the partial derivative

120
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:27,482
with respect to y would be
zero, but with respect to x,

121
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:30,087
when you're moving in
the x direction here,

122
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:31,631
the slope is clearly negative,

123
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:34,291
because as you take positive
steps in the x direction,

124
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,390
the height of your tangent
plane is decreasing,

125
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,224
which corresponds to if you
take tiny steps on your graph,

126
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:43,069
then the height will decrease
in a manner proportional

127
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:45,482
to the size of those tiny steps.

128
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:47,623
So what this gives you
here is gonna be a system

129
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:50,636
of equations where you're
solving for the value of x not

130
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:53,539
and y not that satisfies
both of these equations,

131
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:54,372
and in future videos,

132
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:56,655
I'll go through specific examples of this.

133
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:59,935
For now, I just wanna give a
good conceptual understanding,

134
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:01,211
but one very important thing to notice

135
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,118
is that just because this
condition is satisfied,

136
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:05,911
meaning your tangent plane is flat,

137
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:08,612
just because that's satisfied,
doesn't necessarily mean

138
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:10,108
that you've found the maximum.

139
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:12,959
That's just one requirement
that it has to satisfy,

140
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,114
but for one thing, if you
found the tangent plane

141
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,472
at other little peaks, like
this guy here or this guy here,

142
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:20,432
or all of the little bumps that go up,

143
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:23,238
those tangent planes would also be flat,

144
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:24,870
and those little bumps
actually have a name

145
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,921
because this comes up a lot.

146
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:30,959
They're called local Minima,
or local Maxima, sorry,

147
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,126
so those guys are called local Maxima.

148
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:37,975
Maxima is just the plural of Maximum,

149
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:41,144
and local means that it's
relative to a single point,

150
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:43,830
so it's basically, if you
walk in any direction,

151
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,157
when you're on that little
peak, you'll go downhill,

152
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:48,423
so relative to the neighbors
of that little point,

153
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:51,672
it is a maximum, but relative
to the entire function,

154
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:55,404
these guys are the shorter
mountains next to Mount Everest,

155
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:57,008
but there's also another circumstance

156
00:05:57,008 --> 00:06:00,034
where you might find a flat tangent plane,

157
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:01,497
and that's at the Minima points, right?

158
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:04,013
If you have the global
Minimum, the absolute smallest,

159
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:06,971
or also just the local
Minima, these inverted peaks,

160
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,116
you'll also find flat tangent planes.

161
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:10,272
So what that means, first of all,

162
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,013
is that when you're minimizing a function,

163
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:13,878
you also have to look
for this requirement,

164
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:16,269
where all the partial
derivatives are zero,

165
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:18,103
but it mainly just means
that your job isn't done

166
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:18,936
once you've done this.

167
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:20,678
You have to do more tests to check

168
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,483
whether or not what you
found is a local Maximum

169
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,922
or a local Minimum, or a global Maximum,

170
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:26,051
and these requirements, by the way,

171
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:28,931
often you'll see them written
in a more succinct form,

172
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,778
where instead of saying
all the partial derivatives

173
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:33,712
have to be zero, which
is what you need to find,

174
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:34,929
they'll write it in a different form

175
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:38,693
where you say that the
gradient of your function, f,

176
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:39,961
which, of course, is just the vector

177
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:42,249
that contains all those
partial derivatives.

178
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:44,388
Its first component is
the partial derivative

179
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:45,988
with respect to the first variable,

180
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,286
its second component is
the partial derivative

181
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:49,878
with respect to the second variable,

182
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:52,190
and if there's more variables,
you would keep going,

183
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,611
you'd say that this whole thing

184
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:56,660
has to equal the zero vector,
the vector that has nothing

185
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,454
but zeroes as its components,

186
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:02,117
and it's kind of a
common, abusive notation.

187
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:05,177
People will just call
that zero vector, zero,

188
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:07,765
and maybe they'll emphasize
it by making it bold,

189
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:09,244
because the number zero is not a vector

190
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:11,342
and often making things bold emphasizes

191
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:13,309
that you want to be referring to a vector,

192
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,642
but this gives a very succinct way

193
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,214
of describing the requirement.

194
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:18,345
You're just looking for where
the gradient of your function

195
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:20,172
is equal to the zero vector, and that way,

196
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,747
you can just write it on
one line, but in practice,

197
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:24,406
every time that you're expanding that out,

198
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:25,801
what that means is you find

199
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:27,372
all of the different partial derivatives,

200
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:30,111
so this is really just a matter
of notational convenience

201
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:32,655
and using less space on a blackboard,

202
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:34,900
but whenever you see this,
that the gradient equals zero,

203
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,250
what you should be thinking of

204
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,283
is the idea that the tangent plane,

205
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,457
the tangent plane is completely flat,

206
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:41,997
and as I just said, that's not enough

207
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:44,257
because you might also
be finding local Maxima

208
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:47,147
or Minima points, but in
multivariable calculus,

209
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:49,297
there's also another possibility,

210
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:51,791
a place where the tangent plane is flat,

211
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,532
but what you're looking at
is neither a local Maximum

212
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:56,971
nor a local Minimum, and this is the idea

213
00:07:56,971 --> 00:08:00,422
of a saddle point, which is
new to multivariable calculus,

214
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:02,597
and that's what I'll be talking
about in the next video,

215
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:03,830
so I will see you then.
