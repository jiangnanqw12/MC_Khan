00:00:00,379 --> 00:00:01,295
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,295 --> 00:00:03,061
So I'm gonna start talking about curl.

3
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:06,256
Curl is one of those very
cool vector calculus concepts,

4
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,067
and you'll be pretty happy
that you've learned it

5
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:09,654
once you have, if for no other reason

6
00:00:09,654 --> 00:00:11,487
because it's kind of
artistically pleasing.

7
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:12,738
And, there's two different versions,

8
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:15,420
there's a two-dimensional curl
and a three-dimensional curl.

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,739
And naturally enough, I'll start talking

10
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:17,945
about the two-dimensional version

11
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:20,382
and kind of build our
way up to the 3D one.

12
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:21,768
And in this particular video,

13
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:23,197
I just want to lay down the intuition

14
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:25,410
for what's visually going on.

15
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,293
And, curl has to do with the
fluid flow interpretation

16
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:29,589
of vector fields.

17
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:30,661
Now this is something
that I've talked about

18
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:31,533
in other videos,

19
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,946
especially the ones on
divergents if you watch that,

20
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:35,912
but just as a reminder,
you kind of imagine

21
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:38,125
that each point in space is a particle,

22
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,293
like an air molecule or a water molecule.

23
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:41,836
And since what a vector field does

24
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:45,010
is associate each point in
space with some kind of vector,

25
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,513
now remember we don't always
draw every single vector,

26
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:49,055
we just draw a small sub-sample,

27
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:51,446
but in principle, every
single point in space

28
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:52,955
has a vector attached to it.

29
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:54,547
You can think of each particle,

30
00:00:54,547 --> 00:00:56,826
each one of these water
molecules or air molecules,

31
00:00:56,826 --> 00:01:01,096
as moving over time in such a
way that the velocity vector

32
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:03,531
of its movement at any given point in time

33
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,297
is the vector that it's attached to.

34
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:06,951
So as it moves to a
different location in space

35
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:08,671
and that velocity vector changes,

36
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:10,750
it might be turning or
it might be accelerating,

37
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,226
and that velocity might change.

38
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:16,393
And you end up kind of a
trajectory for your point.

39
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:19,511
And since every single
point is moving in this way,

40
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:21,277
you can start thinking about a flow,

41
00:01:21,277 --> 00:01:23,333
kind of a global view of the vector field.

42
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,696
And for this particular example,

43
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:26,752
this particular vector
field that I have pictured,

44
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:28,630
I'm gonna go ahead and put a blue dot

45
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,594
at various points in space,

46
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:32,180
and, each one of these you can think of

47
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,304
as representing a water
molecule or something,

48
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:36,539
and I'm just gonna let it play.

49
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:39,355
And at any given moment,
if you look at the movement

50
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:41,008
of one of these blue dots,

51
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:43,155
it's moving along the
vector that it's attached to

52
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:45,545
at that point, or if that
vector's not pictured,

53
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:47,110
you know the vector that
would be attached to it

54
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,697
at that point.

55
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:50,686
And as we get kind of a
feel for what's going on

56
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:52,094
in this entire flow,

57
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:55,827
I want you to notice a
couple of particular regions.

58
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:57,555
First, let's take a look at this region

59
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:59,365
over here on the right.

60
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:00,660
Kind of around here.

61
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,432
And just kind of concentrate
on what's going on there.

62
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:04,706
And I'll go ahead

63
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:07,263
and start playing the animation over here.

64
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:09,074
And what's most noticeable
about this region

65
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:11,778
is that there's counterclockwise rotation.

66
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:14,259
And this corresponds to an
idea that the vector field

67
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,874
has a curl here, and
I'll go very specifically

68
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:18,729
into what curl means, but just right now

69
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,629
you should have the idea that in a region

70
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,573
where there's counterclockwise rotation,

71
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,808
we want to say the curl is positive.

72
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:27,512
Whereas, if you look at a
region that also has rotation,

73
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,657
but clockwise, going the other way,

74
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:32,026
we think of that as being negative curl.

75
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,948
Here I'll start it over here.

76
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:35,401
And in contrast, if you look at a place

77
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:38,195
where there's no rotation,
where like at the center here,

78
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:40,474
you have some points coming
in from the top right

79
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:42,329
and from the bottom
left, and then going out

80
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,380
from the other corners.

81
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,677
But there's no net rotation.

82
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:48,945
If you were to just put like a
twig somewhere in this water,

83
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:50,934
it wouldn't really be rotating.

84
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,499
These are regions where you think of them

85
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,666
as having zero curl.

86
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,483
So with that as a general idea,
clockwise rotation regions

87
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:59,025
correspond to positive curl.

88
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:01,125
Counterclockwise rotation regions

89
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,309
correspond to negative curl,

90
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,523
and then no rotation
corresponds to zero curl.

91
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:06,691
In the next video I'm
gonna start going through

92
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:08,545
what this means in terms
of the underlying function

93
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:11,093
defining the vector field
and how we can start looking

94
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:14,177
at the partial differential
information of that function

95
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:17,284
to quantify this intuition
of fluid rotation.

96
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:19,809
And what's neat is that it's
not just about fluid rotation.

97
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:22,760
If you have vector fields in other context

98
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,017
and you just imagine that
they represent a fluid,

99
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:26,201
even though they don't,

100
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,123
this idea rotation and curling

101
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,844
actually has certain importance

102
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,526
in ways that you totally wouldn't expect.

103
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:34,671
The gradient turns out
to relate to the curl,

104
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:36,929
even though you wouldn't
necessarily think the grading

105
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:38,695
has something to do with fluid rotation.

106
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,320
In electromagnetism, this
idea of fluid rotation

107
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,415
has a certain importance,

108
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,493
even though fluids
aren't actually involved.

109
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:47,041
So, it's more general than
just the representation

110
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,432
that we have here, but
it's a very strong visual

111
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:53,078
to have in your mind as
you study vector fields.
