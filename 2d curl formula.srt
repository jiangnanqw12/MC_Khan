00:00:00,544 --> 00:00:01,821
- [Voiceover] So after
introducing the idea

2
00:00:01,821 --> 00:00:04,294
of fluid rotation in a
vector field like this,

3
00:00:04,294 --> 00:00:06,499
let's start tightening up
our grasp on this intuition

4
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:09,460
to get something that we can
actually apply formulas to.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,062
So a vector field like
the one that I had there,

6
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:13,523
that's two-dimensional,
is given by a function

7
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:15,114
that has a two-dimensional input

8
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,297
and a two-dimensional output.

9
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:19,340
And it's common to write the
components of that output

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,300
as the functions p and q.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,123
So, each one of those p and q,

12
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:27,722
takes in two different
variables as it's input.

13
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,963
P and q.

14
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,121
And what I want to do here, is
talk about this idea of curl

15
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:37,566
and you might write it down as just curl,

16
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:40,096
curl of v, the vector field.

17
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:43,161
Which takes in the same inputs
that the vector field does.

18
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:45,240
And because this is the
two-dimensional example,

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,343
I might write,

20
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:48,119
just to distinguish it from
three-dimensional curl,

21
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,242
which is something we'll get
later on, two d curl of v.

22
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:53,866
So you're kind of thinking of
this as a differential thing,

23
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,526
in the same way that you have, you know,

24
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:59,764
a derivative, dx is gonna take
in some kind of a function.

25
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:01,703
And you give it a function and
it gives you a new function,

26
00:01:01,703 --> 00:01:02,620
the derivative.

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,360
Here, you think of this 2d
curl, as like an operator,

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,438
you give it a function,
a vector field function,

29
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:09,365
and it gives you another function,

30
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:12,604
which in this case will be scalar valued.

31
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:13,626
And the reason it's scalar valued,

32
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,263
is because at every given point,

33
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:16,645
you want it to give you a number.

34
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:18,340
So if I look back at the vector field,

35
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,582
that I have here,

36
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:21,277
we want, that at a point like this,

37
00:01:21,277 --> 00:01:23,146
where there's a lot of
counter-clockwise rotation

38
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,865
happening around it, for the curl function

39
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:26,803
to return a positive number.

40
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:28,545
But at a point like
this, where there's some,

41
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:31,599
where there's clockwise
rotation happening around it,

42
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,082
you want the curl to
return a negative number.

43
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:37,659
So, let's start thinking
about what that should mean.

44
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:38,959
And a good way to understand this

45
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,085
two-dimensional curl function

46
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:41,502
and start to get a feel for it,

47
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:45,159
is to imagine the
quintessential 2d curl scenario.

48
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,262
Well let's say you have a point

49
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:48,444
and this here's going to be our point, xy,

50
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:49,802
sitting of somewhere in space.

51
00:01:49,802 --> 00:01:51,846
And let's say there's no
vector attached to it,

52
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:55,619
as in the values, p and
q, and x and y, are zero.

53
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,266
And then let's say that
to the right of it,

54
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,298
you have a vector pointing straight up.

55
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:02,260
Above it, in the vector field,

56
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,257
you have a vector pointing
straight to the left,

57
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,067
to it's left, you have one
pointing straight down,

58
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:10,457
and below it, you have one
pointing straight to the right.

59
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:11,966
So in terms of the
functions, what that means,

60
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,638
is this vector, to it's right,

61
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:15,461
whatever point it's evaluated at,

62
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:18,839
that's gonna be q is greater than zero.

63
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,638
So this function q, that
corresponds to the y component,

64
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:23,646
the up and down component of each vector,

65
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:25,202
when you evaluate it at this point,

66
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:26,723
to the right of our xy point,

67
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:28,859
q's gonna be greater than zero.

68
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:31,262
Where as if you evaluate
it to the left over here,

69
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:35,116
q would be less than zero, less than zero,

70
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:38,879
in our kind of, perfect curl
will be positive example.

71
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,086
And then these bottom guys,

72
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:42,025
if you start thinking
about what this means for,

73
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:43,604
you'd have a rightward vector below,

74
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:45,508
and a leftward vector above,

75
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:48,318
the one below it, whatever
point you're evaluating that at,

76
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:50,524
p, which gives us the kind of,

77
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,021
left right component of these vectors,

78
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,157
since it's the first
component of the output,

79
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:56,108
would have to be positive.

80
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:58,580
And then above it, above it here,

81
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,821
when you evaluate p at that point,

82
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:02,702
would have to be negative.

83
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:04,827
Where as p, if you did it on
the left and right points,

84
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:07,467
would be equal to zero because
there's no x component.

85
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,878
And similarly q, if you did it
on the top and bottom points,

86
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:12,316
since there's no up and down
component of those vectors,

87
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:13,593
would also be zero.

88
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,636
So this is just the, the very specific,

89
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:18,156
almost contrived scenario
that I'm looking at.

90
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,232
And I want to say, hey if this
should have positive curl,

91
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:23,752
maybe if we look at the information,

92
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:25,748
the partial derivative
information to be specific,

93
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:28,454
about p and q, in a scenario like this,

94
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:31,716
it'll give us a way to
quantify the idea of curl.

95
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:33,052
And first let's look at p.

96
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:35,734
So p starts positive, and as y increases,

97
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:38,218
as the y value of our input increases,

98
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,712
it goes from being positive
to zero, to negative.

99
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:44,232
So we would expect, that
the partial derivative of p,

100
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:46,136
with respect to y,

101
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:48,957
so as we change that y component,
moving up in the plane,

102
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:52,150
and look at the x
component of the vectors,

103
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,669
that should be negative.

104
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,016
That should be negative in circumstances

105
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:57,618
where we want positive curl.

106
00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:59,289
So all of this we're looking at cases,

107
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,913
you know the quintessential
case where curl is positive.

108
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,632
So evidently, this is a fact,

109
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:05,455
that corresponds to positive curl.

110
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,556
Where as q, let's take a look at q.

111
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,576
It starts negative,
when you're at the left.

112
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:12,514
And then becomes zero,
then it becomes positive.

113
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:16,019
So here, as x increases, q increases.

114
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,353
So we're expecting that a
partial derivative of q,

115
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:22,730
with respect to x, should be positive.

116
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,797
Or at the very least,
the situations where,

117
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,188
the partial derivative of q
with respect to x is positive,

118
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:31,113
corresponds to positive
two-dimensional curl.

119
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:32,657
And in fact, it turns out,

120
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:34,956
these guys tell us all you need to know.

121
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:36,418
We can say as a formula,

122
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:41,418
that the 2d curl, 2d curl,
of our vector field v,

123
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,738
as a function of x and y,

124
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:50,721
is equal to the partial
derivative of q with respect to x.

125
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:54,378
Partial derivative of
q, with respect to x,

126
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,804
and then I'm gonna subtract
off the partial of p,

127
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:58,116
with respect to y.

128
00:04:58,116 --> 00:04:59,567
Because I want, when this is negative,

129
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,377
for that to correspond
with more positive 2d curl.

130
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:05,697
So I'm gonna subtract off, partial of p,

131
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:08,867
with respect to y.

132
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,144
And this right here,

133
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:13,046
is the formula for two-dimensional curl.

134
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,845
Which basically, you can
think of it as a measure,

135
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,041
at any given point you're asking,

136
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,839
how much does the surrounding
information to that point,

137
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,604
look like this set-up,

138
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:23,680
like this perfect
counter-clockwise rotation set-up?

139
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,097
And the more it looks like this set-up,

140
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:27,802
the more this value will be positive.

141
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:29,044
And if it was the opposite of this,

142
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:30,716
if each of the vectors was turned around

143
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:32,016
and you have clockwise rotation,

144
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:34,304
each of these values
will become the negative

145
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:35,744
of what it had been before.

146
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:38,379
So 2d curl would end up being negative.

147
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,877
And in the next video,
I'll show some examples

148
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:42,913
of what it looks like to use this formula.
