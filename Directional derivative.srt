00:00:00,575 --> 00:00:01,507
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:04,107
So here I'm gonna talk about
the directional derivative

3
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:05,474
and that's a way to extend the idea

4
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:07,174
of a partial derivative.

5
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,240
And partial derivatives, if you remember,

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,374
have to do with functions

7
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:12,375
with some kind of multi-variable input,

8
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,632
and I'll just use two inputs

9
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:15,112
because that's the easiest to think about,

10
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:18,341
and it could be some
single variable output.

11
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:20,141
It could also deal with
vector variable outputs.

12
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:21,311
We haven't gotten to that yet.

13
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:23,044
So, we'll just think
about a single variable,

14
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:25,074
ordinary real number output that's,

15
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:27,307
you know, an expression of x and y,

16
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:28,875
and the partial derivative.

17
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,700
One of the ways I said
you could think about it

18
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,174
is to take a look at the input space,

19
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:34,308
your x and y-plane.

20
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:35,475
So, this would be the x-axis,

21
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:36,641
This is y.

22
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:38,141
And you know, vaguely, in your mind,

23
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:40,874
you're thinking that somehow
this outputs to a line.

24
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,141
This outputs to just the real numbers.

25
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,707
And maybe you're thinking
about a transformation

26
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:46,474
that takes it there, or maybe you're just

27
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:48,141
thinking, "Okay, this is the input space.

28
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:49,541
"That's the output."

29
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,908
And when you take the partial derivative,

30
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:52,441
at some kind of point...

31
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:53,841
So, I'll write it out like

32
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:56,874
partial derivative of f with respect to x

33
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:59,063
at a point like one, two.

34
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:01,274
You think about that point.

35
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:04,508
You know one, y is equal to two.

36
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:06,174
And if you're taking with respect to x,

37
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:07,713
you think about just
nudging it a little bit

38
00:01:07,713 --> 00:01:09,471
in that x-direction, and you see

39
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:12,216
what the resulting nudge
is in the output space.

40
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:13,441
And the ratio between the size

41
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,374
of that resulting nudge, the original one,

42
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:17,041
the ratio between, you know, partial-f

43
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,774
and partial-x is the value that you want.

44
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:21,408
And when you did it with respect to y,

45
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,576
you know you were thinking about traveling

46
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:26,608
in a different direction,
maybe you nudge it straight up.

47
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:27,707
And you're wondering, "Okay, how does

48
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:29,274
"that influence the output?"

49
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:31,874
And the question here, with
directional derivatives,

50
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,273
what if you have some vector, v,

51
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:37,341
I'll give a little
vector hat on top of it,

52
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:39,675
that, you know, I don't
know, let's say it's

53
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:43,881
negative one, two, is the vector.

54
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,076
So you'd be thinking about that as a step

55
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:47,775
of negative one in the x-direction,

56
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,740
and then two more in the y-direction.

57
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,408
So, it's gonna be something
that ends up there.

58
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,674
This is your vector, v.

59
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:56,208
At least, if you're
thinking of v as stemming

60
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,575
from the original point.

61
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,941
And you're wondering, "What does a nudge

62
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:01,341
"in that direction do
to the function itself?"

63
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:03,541
And remember, with these
original, you know, nudges

64
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,208
in the x-direction, nudges in the y,

65
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,608
you're not really thinking of it as,

66
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:07,941
"You know, this is kind of a large step."

67
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:09,207
You're really thinking
of it as something as

68
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:10,607
itty-itty-bitty-bitty.

69
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:11,940
You know it's not that,
but it's really something

70
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,875
very, very small, and
formally you'd be thinking

71
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,208
about the limit as this gets
really, really. really small

72
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,374
approaching zero.

73
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:19,408
And this gets really, really
small approaching zero,

74
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:21,308
what does the ration of the two approach?

75
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,208
And similarly with the
y, you're not thinking

76
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,478
of it as something,
"This is pretty sizable,"

77
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,541
but it would be something
really, really small.

78
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,041
And the directional derivative is similar.

79
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,674
You're not thinking of the actual vector

80
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,495
actually taking a step along that,

81
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:34,774
but you'd be thinking
of taking a step along,

82
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:38,931
say, h multiplied by that vector,

83
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:41,441
and h might represent some
really, really small numbers.

84
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:46,155
You know, maybe this here is like 0.001.

85
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:47,441
And when you're doing this formula,

86
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:50,171
you'd just be thinking the
limit as h goes to zero.

87
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,808
So, the directional derivative is saying

88
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:54,241
when you take a slight
nudge in the direction

89
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,907
of that vector, what is the
resulting change to the output?

90
00:02:57,907 --> 00:02:59,341
And one way to think
about this is you say,

91
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:01,708
"Well, that slight nudge of the vector..."

92
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,240
If we actually expand things out

93
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,681
and we look at the definition itself,

94
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:07,537
it'll be negative h, negative
one times that component,

95
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:10,017
and then two-h here.

96
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:14,475
So it's kind of like you
took negative one nudge,

97
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:17,841
in the x-direction, and then
two nudges in the y-direction.

98
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:20,841
You know, so for whatever
your nudge in the v-direction,

99
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:23,841
there, you take a negative one step by x,

100
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,941
and then two of them up by y.

101
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:27,378
So, when we actually write this out...

102
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:29,337
The notation, by the way, is

103
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:32,475
you take that same nabla from the gradient

104
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:34,175
but then you put the vector down here.

105
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:35,675
So, this is the directional derivative

106
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:36,907
in the direction of v.

107
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:39,185
And there's a whole bunch
of other notations too.

108
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,908
You know, I think there's
like derivative of f

109
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:43,807
with respect to that vector,

110
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,174
is one way people think about it.

111
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:46,773
Some people will just write like partial

112
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,274
with a little subscript vector.

113
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:49,674
There's a whole bunch
of different notations,

114
00:03:49,674 --> 00:03:50,708
but this is the one I like.

115
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,013
You think that nabla with
the little f down there

116
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:56,707
with a little v for your vector, of f,

117
00:03:56,707 --> 00:03:58,897
and it's still a function of x and y.

118
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,540
And the reason I like this is

119
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,074
it's indicative of how
you end up calculating it,

120
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:06,975
which I'll talk about
at the end of the video.

121
00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:09,041
And for this particular example,

122
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,241
a good guess that you
might have is to say,

123
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,908
"Well, we take a negative
step in the x-direction."

124
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:16,074
So you think of it as whatever the change

125
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:18,274
that's caused by such a
step in the x-direction,

126
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:19,641
you do the negative of that,

127
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,674
and then it's two steps
in the y-direction.

128
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:23,375
So, whatever the change
caused by a tiny step

129
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,010
in the y-direction,

130
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,775
let's just take two of those.

131
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:32,675
Two times partial-f, partial-y.

132
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:35,773
And this is actually how you calculate it.

133
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:37,640
And if I was gonna be more general,

134
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,241
you know, let's say we've got a vector, w.

135
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:41,608
I'm going to keep it abstract

136
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:46,208
and just call it a and
b, as its components,

137
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,674
other than the specific numbers.

138
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:50,311
You would say that the
directional derivative

139
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:52,982
in the direction of w, whatever that is,

140
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:56,407
of f is equal to

141
00:04:56,407 --> 00:05:01,282
a times the partial derivative
of f with respect to x

142
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:05,941
plus b times the partial derivative of f,

143
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:07,568
with respect to y.

144
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:09,907
And this is it.

145
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:12,221
This is the formula that you would use

146
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:14,774
for the directional derivative.

147
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:16,341
And again, the way that
you're thinking about this

148
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:17,842
is you're really saying, you know,

149
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:20,478
you take a little nudge
that's a in the x-direction

150
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:22,107
and b in the y-direction.

151
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:23,575
So, this should kind of make sense.

152
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,241
And sometimes you see this written

153
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,241
not with respect to the
partial derivatives themselves

154
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:30,041
and the actual components, a and b,

155
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,507
but with respect to the gradient.

156
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:34,241
And this is because it
makes it much more compact,

157
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,848
more general, if you're
dealing with other dimensions.

158
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:38,568
So, we'll just write it over here.

159
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:42,374
If you look at this expression,
it looks like a dot product.

160
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:46,464
If you would take the dot
product of the vectors, a, b,

161
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,540
and the one that has the
partial derivatives in it.

162
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,541
So, what's lined up with a
is the partial derivative

163
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,541
with respect to x, partial-f, partial-x,

164
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,641
and what's lined up with b
is the partial derivative

165
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,417
with respect to y.

166
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:04,574
And you look at this and you say,

167
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:06,841
"Hey, a, b, I mean that's
just the original vector.

168
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,608
"Right, that's w.

169
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,608
"That's the vector, w."

170
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:12,141
And then you're dotting this with,

171
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,241
well, partial derivative
with respect to x,

172
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,008
in one component, the
other partial derivative

173
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,377
in the other component.

174
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,108
That's just the gradient.

175
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:21,407
That is the gradient of f.

176
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:24,397
And here, you know, it's
nabla without that little w

177
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:26,384
at the bottom, and this is
why we use this notation

178
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,314
because it's so suggestive of the way

179
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,938
that you ultimately calculate it.

180
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:33,111
So, this is really what
you'll see in a textbook,

181
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:35,711
or see as the compact way of writing it.

182
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:38,651
And you can see how this is
more flexible for dimensions.

183
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:39,741
So, if we were talking about something

184
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,307
that has like a five dimensional input

185
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:43,508
and the vector of the
direction you move has

186
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:44,542
five different components.

187
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:45,375
This is flexible.

188
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,742
When you expand it,
the gradient would have

189
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,747
five components, and the vector itself

190
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:50,475
would have five components.

191
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:52,644
So, this is the directional derivative

192
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:53,608
and how you calculate it.

193
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:54,875
And the way you interpret,

194
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,142
you're thinking of
moving along that vector

195
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:01,075
by a tiny nudge, by a tiny,
you know, little value

196
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,601
multiplied by that vector

197
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:04,679
and saying, "How does
that change the output

198
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,902
"and what's the ratio of
the resulting change?"

199
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:09,841
And in the next video, I'll clarify that

200
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:11,574
with the formal definition

201
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:13,633
of the directional derivative itself.
