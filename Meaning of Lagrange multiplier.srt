1
00:00:00,498 --> 00:00:01,331
- [Instructor] Hey folks.

2
00:00:01,331 --> 00:00:03,189
In this video I wanna show you
something pretty interesting

3
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,367
about these Lagrange multipliers
that we've been studying.

4
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:08,555
So the first portion I'm just
gonna kind of get this set up,

5
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:11,172
which is a lot of review
from what we've seen already,

6
00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:12,958
but I think you're really
gonna like where this is going

7
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,222
in the end.

8
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,111
So one of the examples I
showed, and I think this is a

9
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:17,750
pretty nice prototypical example

10
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,002
for constrained optimization problems,

11
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:21,213
is that you're running a company

12
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:23,772
and you have some kind of revenue function

13
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:26,232
that's dependent on various choices

14
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:27,301
you make in running the company,

15
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,804
and I think I said the
number of hours of labor

16
00:00:29,804 --> 00:00:32,310
you employ and the number
of tons of steel you use,

17
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,970
you know, if you were
manufacturing something metallic.

18
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,678
And, you know, this might be
modeled as some multivariable

19
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:39,513
function of h and s, right
now we don't really care

20
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:40,879
about the specifics.

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,591
And you're trying to maximize this, right,

22
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:44,579
that's kind of the
whole point of this unit

23
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,063
that we've been doing, is
that you're trying to maximize

24
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:49,005
some function, but you have a constraint.

25
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,716
This is the real world, you
can't just spend infinite money,

26
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:54,488
you have some kind of budget,
some sort of amount of money

27
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,472
you spend as a function of
those same choices you make,

28
00:00:57,472 --> 00:01:00,421
the hours of labor you employ,
the tons of steel you use.

29
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,228
And this, again, it's gonna equal some

30
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,259
multivariable function
that tells you, you know,

31
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:06,064
how much money you spend
for a given amount of hours

32
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:08,761
and given number of tons of steel.

33
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:10,715
And you set this equal to some constant,

34
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:14,431
this tells you the amount of
money you're willing to spend.

35
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,857
And our goal has been to
maximize some function,

36
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:18,712
subject to a constraint like this.

37
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,413
And the mental model you have in mind

38
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,485
is that you're looking in the input space,

39
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:23,890
inside the x-y plane,

40
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,889
or I guess really, it's the
h-s plane in this case, right.

41
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:29,408
Your inputs are h and s,
and points in this plane

42
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:31,317
tell you possible choices you can make

43
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:33,670
for hours of labor and tons of steel.

44
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,595
And you think of this budget

45
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,702
as some kind of curve
in that plane, right.

46
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:41,421
All the sets of h and s that equal $10,000

47
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:43,577
is gonna give you some kind of curve.

48
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:45,135
And the core value we care about is that,

49
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:46,774
when you maximize this revenue,

50
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,407
you know, when you set
it equal to a constant

51
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:51,607
I'm gonna call M star, that's
like the maximum possible

52
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:54,168
revenue, that's gonna give you a contour

53
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:56,275
that's just barely tangent

54
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:58,988
to the constraint curve.

55
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,014
And if that seems unfamiliar,

56
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:03,328
definitely take a look at the
videos preceding this one.

57
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:04,787
But, just to kind of continue the review,

58
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:06,122
this gave us the really nice property

59
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:08,744
that you look at the gradient vector

60
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:11,167
for the thing you're
trying to maximize, R,

61
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:14,793
and that's gonna be proportional
to the gradient vector

62
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:19,659
for the constraint function,
for this B, so gradient of B.

63
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,543
And this is because
gradients are perpendicular

64
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:22,474
to contour lines.

65
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:25,176
Again, this should feel mostly
like review at this point.

66
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:29,990
So the core idea was that
we take this gradient of R,

67
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,929
and then make it proportional,
with some kind of

68
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,599
proportionality constant lambda,

69
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,178
to the gradient of B, to the gradient

70
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:38,947
of the constraint function.

71
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:41,893
And up till this point, this value lambda

72
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:43,562
has been wholly uninteresting.

73
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:45,403
It's just been a
proportionality constant, right,

74
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:47,612
because we couldn't guarantee
that the gradient of R

75
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:49,411
is equal to the gradient of B.

76
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,617
All we care about is that they're pointing

77
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:51,893
in the same direction.

78
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:53,959
So we just had this constant sitting here,

79
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,533
and all we really said is
make sure it's not zero.

80
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,677
But here, we're gonna get
to where this little guy

81
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:01,677
actually matters.

82
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:03,359
So, if you'll remember, in the last video,

83
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:06,672
I introduced this function
called the Lagrangian,

84
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:07,736
the Lagrangian.

85
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:09,018
And it takes in multiple inputs,

86
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:11,234
they'll be the same inputs that you have

87
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,605
for your budget function
and your revenue function,

88
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,033
or more generally, the constraint

89
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,731
and the thing you're trying to maximize.

90
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:18,961
It takes in those same variables,

91
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:21,850
but, also, as another one of its inputs,

92
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,596
it takes in lambda.

93
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:25,915
So, it is a higher-dimensional function

94
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,854
than both of these two, because
we've got this extra lambda.

95
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:32,184
And the way it's defined looks
a little strange at first,

96
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,690
it just seems kind of like this random

97
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,339
hodgepodge of functions
that we're putting together.

98
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:38,770
But, last time, I kind of walked through

99
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,747
why this makes sense.

100
00:03:39,747 --> 00:03:41,732
You take the thing you're
trying to maximize,

101
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:44,305
and you subtract off this lambda,

102
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:48,176
multiplied by the constraint function,

103
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,426
which is B of those inputs,

104
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:55,043
minus, and then whatever
this constant is here, right.

105
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:56,956
I'm gonna give it a name,
I'm gonna call this constant

106
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:58,132
lowercase b.

107
00:03:58,132 --> 00:04:00,352
So maybe we're thinking of it as $10,000,

108
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:03,097
but it's whatever your actual budget is.

109
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:04,356
So we think of that, and I'm just gonna

110
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:08,857
emphasize here that
that's a constant, right,

111
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:12,153
that this b is being treated
as a constant right now.

112
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,874
You know, we're thinking
of h and s and lambda

113
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:16,564
all as these variables, and this gives us

114
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:19,510
some multivariable function.

115
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,494
And if you'll remember
from the last video,

116
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:24,323
the reason for defining this function

117
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,875
is it gives us a really
nice compact way to solve

118
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,401
the constraint optimization problem.

119
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:32,507
You set the gradient of L equal to zero,

120
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:34,444
or really the zero vector,
right, it'll be a vector

121
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:36,655
with three components here.

122
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:39,637
And when you do that, you'll
find some solution, right,

123
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:44,324
you'll find some solution,
which I'll call h star,

124
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:48,334
s star, and lambda, here
I'll give it that green

125
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:50,501
lambda color, lambda star.

126
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:57,367
You'll find some value
that, when you input this

127
00:04:57,367 --> 00:05:00,832
into the function, the
gradient will equal zero.

128
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:02,450
And, of course, you might
find multiple of these, right,

129
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,059
you might find multiple
solutions to this problem,

130
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:08,352
but what you do is, for each
one of them you're gonna take

131
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:11,568
a look at h star and s star,
then you're gonna plug those

132
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,786
into the revenue function, or
the thing that you're trying

133
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:14,795
to maximize.

134
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:17,199
And, typically, you only get
a handful, you get a number,

135
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,768
then you can actually
plug each one of them into

136
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:21,196
the revenue function, and
you'll just check which one

137
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,908
of them makes this function the highest.

138
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,436
And whatever the highest value
this function can achieve,

139
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:29,333
that is M star, that is the
maximum possible revenue,

140
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,250
subject to this budget.

141
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:34,785
But it's interesting that when
you solve this, you get some

142
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:37,918
specific value of lambda,
right, there's a specific

143
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,529
lambda star that will be
associated with the solution.

144
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:43,659
And, like I said, this
turns out not to just be

145
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,336
some dummy variable.

146
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:48,605
It's gonna carry information
about how much we can increase

147
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:51,876
the revenue if we increase that budget.

148
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:53,518
And, here, let me show you what I mean.

149
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:57,876
So we've got this M star,
and I'll just write it again,

150
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,306
M star here.

151
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:01,716
And what that equals, I'm
saying that's the maximum

152
00:06:01,716 --> 00:06:03,000
possible revenue.

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,834
So that's gonna be the revenue
when you evaluate it at

154
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,353
h star,

155
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:08,853
h star and s star.

156
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:13,365
And h star and s star, they
are whatever the solution

157
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:18,018
to this gradient of the Lagrangian
equals zero equation is.

158
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:20,092
You set this multivariable
function equal to the

159
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:23,377
zero vector, you solve when
each of its partial derivatives

160
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:26,202
equal zero, and you'll
get some kind of solution.

161
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:28,103
So when you plug that
solution in the revenue,

162
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:31,081
that gives you the
maximum possible revenue.

163
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:33,981
But what we could do is
consider this as a function

164
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,967
of the budget.

165
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:38,542
Now, this is the kind of thing
that looks a little bit wacky

166
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,831
if you're just looking at the formulas.

167
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:42,619
But if you actually
think about what it means

168
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,880
in this context of kind
of a revenue and a budget,

169
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,741
I think it's actually pretty sensible,

170
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:50,212
where, really, if we consider
this b no longer to be

171
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:52,464
constant but something that
you could change, right,

172
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:55,169
you're wondering, well what
if I had a $20,000 budget,

173
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,283
or what if I had a $15,000 budget?

174
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,608
You wanna ask the question,
what happens as you change

175
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:00,850
this b.

176
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,677
Well, the maximizing
value, h star and s star,

177
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:08,596
each one of those guys is
gonna depend on b, right.

178
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,422
As you change what this
constant is, it's gonna change

179
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:13,950
the values at which the
gradient of the Lagrangian

180
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,633
equals zero.

181
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:18,800
So, I'm gonna rewrite this function as

182
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:23,226
the revenue evaluated
at h star and s star,

183
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:25,352
but now I'm gonna consider
that h star and s star

184
00:07:25,352 --> 00:07:27,852
each as functions of b, right,

185
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,259
because they depend on it in some way.

186
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,065
As you change b, it changes
the solution to this problem

187
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:35,238
It's very implicit and it's
kind of hard to think about.

188
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,460
It's hard to think, okay,
as I change this b, how much

189
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,628
does that change h star.

190
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:40,304
Well that depends on what the, you know,

191
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,963
what the definition of R
was and everything there.

192
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,155
But, in principle, in this
context, I think it's quite

193
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:45,988
intuitive.

194
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:48,040
You have a maximum possible revenue,

195
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,030
and that depends on what your budget is.

196
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,075
So, what turns out to be a
beautiful, absolutely beautiful

197
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,075
magical fact

198
00:07:57,204 --> 00:07:59,204
is that this lambda star

199
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,472
is equal to the derivative of M star,

200
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:08,820
the derivative of this
maximum possible revenue

201
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:13,695
with respect to b, with
respect to the budget.

202
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:17,002
And let me just show you what
that actually means, right.

203
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:19,064
So if, for example, let's say you did

204
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:22,288
all of your calculations and
it turned out that lambda star

205
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,705
was equal to 2.3.

206
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:27,167
You know, previously that just
seemed like some dummy number

207
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,214
that you ignore, and you
just look at whatever the

208
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:30,935
associated values here are.

209
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:33,041
But if you plug this in the
computer and you see lambda star

210
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:37,665
equals 2.3, what that means is,
for a tiny change in budget,

211
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:40,765
like let's say your budget
increases from 10,000

212
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:43,515
to 10,001, it goes up to $10,001,

213
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:48,848
you increase your budget by
just a little bit, a little db.

214
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:51,896
Then the ratio of the change
in the maximizing revenue

215
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,896
to that db is about 2.3.

216
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,204
So what that would mean
is, increasing your budget

217
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,330
by a dollar is gonna increase M star,

218
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,573
over here it would mean
that M star increases

219
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:05,656
by about, you know, $2.30

220
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:09,261
for every dollar that
you increase your budget.

221
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:10,940
And that's information
you'd wanna know, right?

222
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,840
If you see that this
lambda star is a number

223
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,279
bigger than one, you'd say,
hey, maybe we should increase

224
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,134
our budget.

225
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:18,948
We increase it from $10,000
to 10,001 and we're making

226
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,016
more money.

227
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:22,866
So, maybe, as long as lambda
star is greater than one,

228
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,798
you should keep doing
whatever it takes to increase

229
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,273
that budget.

230
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,927
So this fact is quite surprising, I think,

231
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:31,488
and it seems like it totally
comes out of nowhere.

232
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,225
So what I'm gonna do in the
next video is prove this to you,

233
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:37,640
is prove why this is true,
why this lambda star value

234
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,879
happens to be the rate of
change for the maximum value

235
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,595
of the thing we're trying to maximize

236
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:46,709
with respect to this constant,
with respect to whatever

237
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,538
constant you set your
constraint function equal to.

238
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,554
For right now, though, I
just want you to kind of

239
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:54,461
try to sit back and digest
what this means in the context

240
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,665
of this specific economic example.

241
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:58,644
And, even if you never
looked into the proof

242
00:09:58,644 --> 00:09:59,697
and never understood it there,

243
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:02,181
I think this is an
interesting and even useful

244
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:05,841
tidbit of knowledge to have
about Lagrange multipliers.

245
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:07,174
So with that, I'll see
you in the next video.
