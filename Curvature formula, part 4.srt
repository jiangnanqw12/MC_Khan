1
00:00:01,354 --> 00:00:03,746
- [Voiceover] So we've been
talking about curvature.

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:06,834
And this means you've got
some sort of parametric curve,

3
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,390
you might think as parameterized by

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,178
a vector valued function S of t.

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,502
And curvature is supposed to measure

6
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:14,740
just how much this curve actually curves.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,620
So here it's curving quite a
bit, curvature should be high.

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,988
But here it's, you know. relatively

9
00:00:18,988 --> 00:00:21,264
straight so curvature should be low.

10
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:23,284
And I brought up in the last video

11
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:25,212
this pretty complicated formula.

12
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:27,731
And to remind you of the circumstances,

13
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:31,075
I was saying that curvature,
denoted with this little kappa,

14
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:32,907
is typically calculated as the

15
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,975
derivative of the unit
tangent vector function.

16
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:38,527
So we'll think of some kind of function

17
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:41,755
that gives unit tangent
vectors at every single point.

18
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:43,335
So you know, just a vector with

19
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,563
a length of one lying
tangent to the curve.

20
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:47,535
And that's going to be some kind

21
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:49,303
of function of the same parameter.

22
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:51,879
So big T for unit tangent
vector, little t for the

23
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,315
parameter, hopefully
that's not too confusing.

24
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,915
Then we're taking the derivative
of this, not with respect

25
00:00:57,915 --> 00:01:01,979
to t, the parameter, but with
respect to arc length, s.

26
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,347
And by arc length, I mean
if you take a tiny step

27
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:08,271
along the curve, and consider
this to be of size ds,

28
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:11,103
so s typically denotes
length along a curve,

29
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:12,915
this will be a tiny change in length.

30
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:16,607
You're wondering how much that
unit tangent vector changes.

31
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:18,303
And specifically what I mean by that,

32
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:20,439
if you kind of imagine
tangent vectors off sitting in

33
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,295
their own space somewhere,
where each one of them has unit

34
00:01:23,295 --> 00:01:26,939
lengths so they're all just
kind of of the same length

35
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,373
and lets say they're all
stemming from the same points.

36
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:30,319
So rather than drawing them
stemming from the curve,

37
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,619
to show that they're tangent, I just

38
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,223
want to show them in their own space.

39
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:36,567
The derivative, the change in
that tangent vector, would be

40
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:40,303
some, some other vector that
tells you how you move from one

41
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:42,907
to the other, kind of tells
you how much it's turning.

42
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:46,295
So the curvature itself is
given not by that vector,

43
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,271
because this would be a vector quantity,

44
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,055
but by the absolute value of it.

45
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:54,003
And I said in the last
video that it turns out

46
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:56,607
that this quantity, when you
work it out for a vector-value

47
00:01:56,607 --> 00:02:00,107
function with components, with componenets

48
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:03,803
x of t, x of t and y of t,

49
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,918
that it happens to equal
this complicated formula.

50
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:13,150
And what I'm gonna do here,
I going to break it down

51
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,933
and show why this formula
isn't actually all that random.

52
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:19,278
It's actually kind of
sensible as a description

53
00:02:19,278 --> 00:02:22,437
for how much the curve
really curves at a point.

54
00:02:22,437 --> 00:02:24,941
So lets start by looking
at the numerator here.

55
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:28,033
This x-prime of t, first
derivative of the first component,

56
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:31,025
times the second derivative of
the second component, minus,

57
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,073
and then kind of symmetrically,

58
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:35,345
y-prime times x double-prime.

59
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:36,462
You might be able to recognize

60
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:38,918
this as a certain cross product.

61
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:42,692
So the cross product, if
we take x-prime, y-prime,

62
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:46,609
and these are still
functions of t, as a vector

63
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,980
crossed with the vector
containing the double primes.

64
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,500
And if you aren't familiar
with the cross products

65
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,844
or you're feeling a little shaky

66
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:55,028
and you kind of want to review,

67
00:02:55,028 --> 00:02:56,680
now would be a good time pause the video,

68
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,536
take a look at the cross product videos,

69
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,232
and remind yourself both of how

70
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:03,364
to compute it and what the
underlying intuition is.

71
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:06,572
Because the way that we compute
a cross product like this is

72
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:09,520
you take the components in the
diagonal here, you know that

73
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,576
rightward diagonal, and
multiply them together.

74
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:16,056
That's where you get your
x-prime, y double-prime.

75
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:18,704
And then you subtract off
the components in the other

76
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:22,232
diagonal, you know it kind
of feels like a determinant.

77
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:24,732
X double-prime, times y-prime.

78
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:28,132
But the way that you
interpret this vector,

79
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:30,060
well I'll get to the
interpretation in just a moment.

80
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,356
First, first let me kind of write out

81
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,588
what this is in terms of our function S.

82
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:38,068
This first vector is just
the first derivative of S,

83
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:41,692
so that's S-prime of t,
the first derivative of S.

84
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:43,364
And we're crossing that with this one,

85
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:46,428
which is the second derivative,
vector value derivative,

86
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:49,011
but the second derivative of S.

87
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:54,116
So before we, before we
do anything else lets just

88
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:57,132
start to think about, what do
both of these vectors mean?

89
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:00,499
How do you interpret the
S-prime and the S double-prime?

90
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:02,379
I'm going to go ahead and give

91
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,123
ourselves a little bit of room here.

92
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:05,771
So I'll draw the curve again.

93
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:09,159
We're on our x, y plane, and
you have some kind of curve.

94
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,667
The function S itself is giving vectors

95
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:16,403
whose tips trace out this curve, right?

96
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:20,467
As T changes, the tips of these
vectors trace out the curve.

97
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:22,999
And now the first derivative,
that first derivative

98
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:26,332
vector, S-prime of t, is telling you

99
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,512
how that tip should move
to go along the curve.

100
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:33,088
As you go from one S
vector to another S vector,

101
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:35,340
what direction should that tip move.

102
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,380
And what this means is
that at every given point,

103
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,076
when you kind of do this
in a limiting fashion

104
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:43,560
and you only look at infinitesimal
changes in the original

105
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,344
vector, you always get some
kind of tangent vector, right?

106
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:50,062
So all of these are tangent
vectors, not necessarily unit,

107
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:53,188
you might have like a very
long tangent vector to indicate

108
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:56,808
that you're traveling very
quickly across that space.

109
00:04:56,808 --> 00:04:58,487
And now, how would you think about

110
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:02,810
the second derivative vector
here, S double-prime of t?

111
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,994
Well the way to do
that, I like to think of

112
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:06,714
all of the tangents
vectors then just kind of

113
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,966
living in their own space, right?

114
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:12,982
If this here is representing
S of t, I just want to

115
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:17,149
look in isolation at what
S-prime of t looks like.

116
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,725
So each one of those
vectors, you know maybe this

117
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:22,465
first one is just is
very long, gargantuan,

118
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:24,345
indicating you're going very quickly.

119
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:27,109
And then after that you've
got something else here,

120
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:28,665
maybe it's pointing a little bit down.

121
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:29,685
And you're kind of thinking about how

122
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:31,357
all of these derivative vectors change,

123
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:33,701
but I want them all
rooted at the same point.

124
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,141
Just see what happens when
they're all rooted at the origin,

125
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,809
because that, that gives
us a way to think about

126
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,993
what changing the vector should look like.

127
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:42,597
So in particular, as you're moving from

128
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:45,453
this vector to this one, the tip should be

129
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:47,541
kind of moving in this direction, right?

130
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,677
So this second derivative
value is going to

131
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:52,533
tell us how the tip of the
first derivative should move.

132
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,065
And then similarly over here it tells us

133
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:56,041
how the tip of that should move.

134
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,081
And just as an example and
kind of a hint as to why this

135
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:01,573
has something to do with curvature,

136
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:05,667
if you have a curve
that turns very sharply,

137
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:09,158
turns very sharply, you would
have you know a tangent vector

138
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:11,328
that starts by pointing up
and to the right and then very

139
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:14,740
quickly is pointing down,
down and to the right.

140
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,808
So if they were off, you know
we'd kind of draw them on

141
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:19,500
their own, rooted in their own location,

142
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,472
you can maybe see how the
second derivative vector

143
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:25,376
is telling it to turn
somehow in that direction.

144
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:28,092
And if you, you know
capture not just those two

145
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:30,996
but infinitesimally what's
going on as you move from

146
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:32,836
one to the next you're gonna get

147
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:36,577
this kind of turning motion
for all of these guys.

148
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:38,713
So the second derivative
vector would be pulling

149
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:41,081
perpendicular, perpendicular to that

150
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:44,261
first derivative vector as
a way of telling it to turn.

151
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:46,281
So just to draw that on
its own, if you have a

152
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,694
first derivative vector, and
then the second derivative

153
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:50,646
vector is perpendicular to it,

154
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:53,686
it's telling it how it
should turn in some way.

155
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:55,682
But if it was, you know
lets say it was not purely

156
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,934
perpendicular but it was
also pointing against,

157
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,514
it would be telling that, that vector,

158
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:02,370
that first derivative vector,
to shrink in some way.

159
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,554
So that would be an indication that

160
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:05,898
not only is it turning
but it's getting smaller,

161
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:09,686
meaning the trajectory based
on S is probably slowing down.

162
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:13,998
And if it was kind of turning
it but also pointing away,

163
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,037
that would mean it's telling the

164
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:16,917
first derivative vector to grow.

165
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,845
So not only should you
be turning on your curve

166
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,633
but you should also be speeding up.

167
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,810
But the case we care about
most is we're just trying to

168
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,060
measure how perpendicular it is, right?

169
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:30,978
And this is where the
cross product comes in,

170
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:32,173
because if you think
about how you interpret

171
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:36,609
that cross product, how you
interpret the cross product,

172
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:38,825
it's basically the area
if you kind of take these

173
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,285
two vectors, tip-to-tail as
they are, and think about

174
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:45,069
the parallelogram that they trace out.

175
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,813
Lets see, so this blue dotted line

176
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:49,261
should be parallel to the blue vector.

177
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:52,521
The area of this, of this
traced out parallelogram

178
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:55,121
for each of them, that's what tells you

179
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:57,745
that's how you interpret
the cross product.

180
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:02,273
The cross product between
S-prime and S double-prime.

181
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,085
So this cross product, by giving
you that area, is kind of a

182
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,405
measure of just how perpendicular
these vectors are, right?

183
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,701
Because if one of them,
if they point very much in

184
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,793
the same direction, right,
and they're only slightly

185
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,089
perpendicular, that means that
the parallelogram they trace,

186
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:20,341
they trace out is gonna
have a very small area.

187
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:22,941
It's gonna be a smaller
area in comparison.

188
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:27,005
So with that, I don't want
this video to run too long,

189
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,001
so I'm gonna call it in
here, but then I'll just

190
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,905
continue on in the next
one through the same

191
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:33,459
line of reasoning to build
to our original formula.
