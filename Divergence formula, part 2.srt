00:00:00,194 --> 00:00:01,515
- [Voiceover] Hello
again, in the last video

2
00:00:01,515 --> 00:00:02,795
we were looking at vector fields that

3
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:04,382
only have an X component,

4
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:05,742
basically meaning all of the vectors

5
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:07,854
point just purely to the
left or to the right,

6
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:09,970
with nothing up and down going on.

7
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,064
Then we landed at the idea that

8
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:13,014
the divergence of V, you know when

9
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,720
you take the divergence of
this vector valued function,

10
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,565
it should definitely have something to do

11
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,863
with the partial derivative of P,

12
00:00:19,863 --> 00:00:21,224
that X component of the output,

13
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:22,791
with respect to X,

14
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,373
and here I wanna do the opposite,

15
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:26,061
and say, okay, what if
we look at functions

16
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:30,405
where that P, that
first component is zero,

17
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,252
but then we have some kind
of positive Q component,

18
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:35,792
some kind of positive,
well maybe not positive,

19
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:38,171
but some kind of non-zero,

20
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,605
so positive or negative Y component,

21
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:41,703
and what this would mean,

22
00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:43,961
instead of thinking about
vector as just left and right,

23
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,790
now we're looking at vectors that

24
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,081
are purely up or down, kind of up or down.

25
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,072
So kind of doing the same
thing we did last time,

26
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:52,921
if we start thinking about cases where

27
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,832
the divergence of our function

28
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:57,163
at a given point should be positive,

29
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:00,587
and an example of that,
you might be saying,

30
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:02,905
nothing is happening at the point itself,

31
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:06,217
so Q itself would be
zero but then below it,

32
00:01:06,217 --> 00:01:07,880
things are kind of going away so

33
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,729
they're pointing down, and above it,

34
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,151
things are going up.

35
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:12,818
So in this case down here,

36
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:14,381
Q is a little bit less than zero,

37
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:16,779
the Y component of that
vector is less than zero,

38
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:19,339
and up here, Q is greater than zero.

39
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:20,761
So here we have the idea
that as you're going

40
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:22,348
from the bottom up,

41
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,928
the Y value of your input is increasing

42
00:01:24,928 --> 00:01:26,798
as you're moving upward in space,

43
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:30,068
the value of Q, this Y
component of the output,

44
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:31,409
should also be increasing because

45
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,110
it goes from negative to zero to positive.

46
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,939
So now you're starting to get this idea

47
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,497
of partial Q with respect to Y,

48
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:41,871
you know, as we change that
Y and move up in space,

49
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:44,289
the value of Q should be positive,

50
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,796
so positive divergence seems to

51
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:47,908
correspond to a positive value here.

52
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,288
And the thinking is actually gonna be

53
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:50,447
almost identical to what we did

54
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:52,337
in the last video with the X component,

55
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:54,041
because you can think
of another circumstance

56
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,769
where maybe you actually have a vector

57
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:57,881
attached to your point
and something's going on,

58
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:59,997
and there even is some
convergence towards it,

59
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:02,391
where you have some fluid flow

60
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:03,550
in towards the point,

61
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,077
but it's just heavily outweighed by

62
00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:08,080
even higher divergence, even higher flow

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,136
away from your point above it,

64
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:11,537
and again you have this idea of

65
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:13,870
Q starts off small, so here's kind of,

66
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,617
Q starts off small, maybe
it's kind of like near zero,

67
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:18,748
and then here Q is something positive

68
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:20,271
and then here it's even more positive,

69
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:23,889
and sort of making up notation here

70
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,617
but I want the idea of kind of small

71
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:27,487
and then medium-sized and then bigger,

72
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:31,549
and once again, the idea
of partial derivative of Q

73
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:34,028
with respect to Y being greater than zero

74
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,487
seems to correspond to
positive divergence,

75
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:37,807
and if you want, you can sketch out

76
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:39,677
many more circumstances and think about

77
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:41,621
what if the vector
started off pointing down,

78
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:42,921
what would positive and negative

79
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:44,691
and zero divergence all look like,

80
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:46,413
but the upshot of it all, pretty much

81
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,303
for the same reasons I went
through in the last video,

82
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:50,702
is this partial derivative
with respect to Y

83
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:53,000
corresponds to the divergence.

84
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,111
And when we combine this with

85
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,450
our conclusions about the X component,

86
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,255
that actually is all you need
to know for the divergence.

87
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:02,855
So just to write it all out,

88
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:05,521
if we have a vector valued
function of X and Y,

89
00:03:07,383 --> 00:03:09,030
and it's got both of its components,

90
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,745
we've got P as the X
component of the output,

91
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:14,231
that first component of the output,

92
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:17,740
and Q, and we're looking
at both of these at once,

93
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,023
the way that we compute divergence,

94
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:25,191
the definition of divergence
of this vector valued function,

95
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:28,767
is to say divergence of V

96
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:32,854
as a function of X and Y,

97
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:38,172
is actually equal to the
partial derivative of P

98
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:41,827
with respect to X, plus,

99
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:45,836
the partial derivative
of Q with respect to Y.

100
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:50,665
And that's it, that is the
formula for divergence,

101
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,514
and hopefully by now,
this isn't just kind of

102
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:54,142
a formula that I'm plopping down for you,

103
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:55,845
but it's something that
makes intuitive sense,

104
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:58,002
when you see this term, this partial P

105
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:00,094
with respect to X, you're thinking about,

106
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,757
oh yes, yes, because if you have

107
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:03,566
flow that's kind of increasing

108
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:05,476
as you move in the X direction,

109
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,527
that's gonna correspond
with movement away,

110
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:08,747
and this partial derivative of Q

111
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:10,213
with respect to Y term,

112
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:11,736
hopefully you're thinking, ah yes,

113
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:14,579
as you're increasing the Y component

114
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,206
of your vector around your point,

115
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:19,109
that corresponds with less
flow in than there is out,

116
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,039
so both of these correspond to that

117
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,519
idea of divergence that we're going for,

118
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,126
and if you just add them up,

119
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,621
this gives you everything
you need to know.

120
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:28,901
And one thing that's pretty neat,

121
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,468
and maybe kind of surprising,

122
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:32,761
is that the way we just
came across this formula,

123
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:34,000
and started to think about it,

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,100
was in the simplified case,

125
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,666
where you have, you
know, just pure movement

126
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,758
in the X direction or pure
movement in the Y direction,

127
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:40,179
but in reality, as we know,

128
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,290
vector fields can look
much more complicated,

129
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,958
and maybe you have something where

130
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,626
you know, it's not just
in the X direction,

131
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:47,451
and there's lots of things going on

132
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:49,018
and you need to account for all of those,

133
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:50,681
and evidently, just looking at the change

134
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,490
in the X component with respect to X,

135
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,037
or the change in the Y
component of the output

136
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:56,310
with respect to the Y
component of the input,

137
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,970
gives you all the
information you need to know.

138
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,576
And basically what's going on here is

139
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:03,587
that any fluid flow
can just be broken down

140
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:05,350
into the X and Y components where

141
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,119
you're just looking at each vector,

142
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,908
you know, whatever vector you have,

143
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,370
it could be broken down into

144
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,300
it's own X and Y components and if you

145
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,621
wanna think kind of concretely about

146
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:15,918
the fluid flow idea, maybe you'd say that

147
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,498
for your point, if you're
looking at a point in space,

148
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,796
you picture a very small box around it,

149
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:21,708
and the reason you only need to

150
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,638
think about X components and Y components

151
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,488
is that you're only really looking at,

152
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:28,088
you know, what's going on
on the left and right side,

153
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:29,408
and then you can kind of calculate

154
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:31,928
what the divergence
according to fluid flowing

155
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:33,289
in through those sides is,

156
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:34,977
and then you just look at kind of,

157
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:37,517
fluid flowing through
the top or the bottom,

158
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,507
and if you kinda shrink this box down,

159
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:42,838
all you really care about is
those two different directions,

160
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:44,809
and anything else, anything that's kind of

161
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:47,449
a diagonal into it, is
really just broken down

162
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,521
into what's the Y component there,

163
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:51,537
what's the, you know,
how is it contributing to

164
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:53,587
movement up through that
bottom part of the box,

165
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,827
and then what's the X component,

166
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:56,067
how's it contributing to movement

167
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:57,830
through that side part of the box.

168
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,176
But anyway, I mean the upshot here

169
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:00,879
is just that the formula for divergence

170
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,878
only involves these two components.
