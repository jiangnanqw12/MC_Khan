1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,073
- [Voiceover] So in the last
video, I introduced this

2
00:00:02,073 --> 00:00:04,796
multi-variable chain
rule and here I want to

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,863
explain a loose intuition
for why it's true,

4
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:10,148
why you would expect
something like this to happen.

5
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:12,339
So the way you think about
an expression like this,

6
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:14,189
you have this multi-variable function

7
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,275
f of xy and you're plugging things in,

8
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:18,096
but just that function itself, you'll be

9
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:21,845
thinking of taking a two dimensional space

10
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:24,718
you know here's our xy plane,

11
00:00:24,718 --> 00:00:28,371
and then mapping it to, you
know, just a real number line

12
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:30,400
and I'll think of this
as f, as the output.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,429
So somehow our whole
function takes things from

14
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:37,755
this two dimensional space
and plugs it onto this output.

15
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:39,296
T you're thinking of just another

16
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:41,129
number line up here, so t, and then

17
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,023
you've got separate functions here,

18
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,255
you know x of t and y of t.

19
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,755
X of t and y of t.

20
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:53,828
Each of which take that same value for

21
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:55,374
a specific input, you know it's not that

22
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:56,556
they're acting on different inputs,

23
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,076
x of some other input t
and y of some other input,

24
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:01,860
it's the same one and then they move that

25
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,948
somewhere to this output space

26
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:06,448
which itself get's moved over.

27
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,048
And in this way you're thinking of it

28
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:10,714
as just a single variable function

29
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:13,026
that goes from t and ultimately outputs f

30
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:14,704
it's just that there's
multi-dimensional stuff

31
00:01:14,704 --> 00:01:16,932
happening in between and now if we start

32
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:19,180
thinking about the derivative of it -

33
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,833
what does that mean, what
does that mean for the

34
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:25,172
conception of the picture
that we have going on here?

35
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,459
Well, that bottom part, that dt

36
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:30,394
you're thinking of as a
tiny change to t, right?

37
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:32,196
So you're thinking of
it as kind of a nudge,

38
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:34,090
I'll draw it as a sizable line here

39
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,543
for like moving from
some original input over,

40
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:38,179
but you might in
principal think of it as a

41
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:40,625
very, very tiny nudge in t.

42
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,831
And over here you'd say
well, that's gonna move

43
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:45,959
your intermediary output in the xy plane

44
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,873
to, you know maybe it'll
move it in some amount,

45
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:51,138
again imagine this is a very small nudge,

46
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:52,137
I'm going to give it some size here

47
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:53,875
just so I can write into it and

48
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,948
then whatever that nudge
in the output space

49
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,889
right, it's a nudge in some direction

50
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:01,501
that's going to correspond
to some change in f.

51
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:05,501
Some change based on the
differential properties

52
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,895
of the multi-variable function itself.

53
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:13,583
And if we think about this, this change

54
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,343
you might break it into components

55
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:20,010
and say this shift here
has some kind of dx,

56
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:23,279
some kind of shift in the x direction

57
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:26,423
and some kind of dy, some
shift in the y direction.

58
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:28,906
But you can actually reason
about what these should be

59
00:02:28,906 --> 00:02:30,349
coz it's not just an arbitrary change in x

60
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,721
or an arbitrary change in y,

61
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:34,975
it's the one that was caused by dt.

62
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:38,721
So if I go over here, I might say that dx

63
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:42,904
is caused by that dt and the whole meaning

64
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:45,131
of the derivative, the whole meaning

65
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,864
of the single variable derivative

66
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:50,614
would be that when we take dx dt,

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,006
this is the factor that
tells us, you know,

68
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,250
a tiny nudge in t, how
much does that change

69
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,450
the x component and if you want you could

70
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,702
think of this as kind of
cancelling out the dts

71
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:02,973
and you're just left with
x, but really you're saying

72
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:05,313
there's a tiny nudge in
t and that results in a

73
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:07,596
change in x and this derivative is what

74
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:10,148
tells you the ratio between those sizes.

75
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,231
And similarly, that change in y here,

76
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:19,404
that change in y is gonna be somehow

77
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:21,987
proportional to the change in t

78
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:24,784
and that proportion is given by the

79
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:26,599
derivative of y with respect to t

80
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,307
that's the whole point of the derivative,

81
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,930
no no, with respect to t and again

82
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,489
you can kind of think of it as if

83
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:34,977
you're cancelling out the ts and

84
00:03:34,977 --> 00:03:37,126
this is why the fractional writing,

85
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:39,553
this Leibniz notation is
actually pretty helpful.

86
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,313
You know, people will say,
oh mathematicians would

87
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:43,928
like, share their heads at the idea of

88
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:47,059
treating these like
fractions, but not only is it

89
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,232
a useful thing to do coz it is a

90
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:51,764
helpful mnemonic, it's
reflective of what you're

91
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,064
gonna do when you make
a very formal argument.

92
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:56,118
And I think I'll do that in
one of the following videos,

93
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:59,520
I'll describe this in a
very, a much more formal way

94
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,442
that's a little bit more airtight than the

95
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,656
kind of hand-waving nudging around.

96
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:05,472
But the intuition you
get from just writing

97
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:08,241
this is a fraction is
basically the scaffolding

98
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:09,700
for that formal argument, so it's a

99
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,144
fine thing to do, I don't
think mathematicians

100
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:14,254
are shaking their heads every time that a

101
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,286
student or a teacher does this.

102
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:18,286
But anyway, so this is kind of gives you

103
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:20,798
what that dx is, what that dy is

104
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,319
and then over here if you're saying

105
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,840
how much does that change
the ultimate output of the f?

106
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,262
You could say, well, your
nudge of size dx over here,

107
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:31,926
you're wondering how much
that changes the output of f,

108
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:34,347
that's the meaning of the
partial derivative, right.

109
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:35,972
If we say we have the partial derivative

110
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,889
with respect to x, what that means,

111
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:42,298
is that if you take a tiny nudge of size x

112
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,792
this is giving you the ratio between that

113
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:48,317
and the ultimate change to
the output that you want.

114
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:50,278
You could think of it like this partial x

115
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:52,701
is cancelling out with
that dx if you wanted

116
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:55,534
or you could just say,
this is a tiny nudge in x,

117
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,318
this is going to result
in some change in f -

118
00:04:57,318 --> 00:04:59,206
I'm not sure what - but the meaning of

119
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:02,965
the derivative is the
ratio between those two

120
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:04,655
and that's what lets you figure it out.

121
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:08,414
And similarly, you might
call this the change in f

122
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:10,747
caused by x, like, due to x.

123
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:16,046
Due to, I should say to dx.

124
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:18,470
But that's not the only thing
changing the value of f right?

125
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,961
That's not the only change happening

126
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:23,747
in the input space, you also
have another change in f

127
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:26,914
and this one I might say is due to dy.

128
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:34,762
Due to that tiny shift in
y and what that's gonna be

129
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:36,254
we know it's going to
be proportional to that

130
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:40,422
tiny shift in y and the
proportionality constant -

131
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:43,638
this is the meaning of
the partial derivative,

132
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:46,433
that when you nudge y in some way it

133
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,582
results in some kind of
nudge in f and the ratio

134
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,438
between those two is what
the derivative gives.

135
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,396
So ultimately, if you
put this all together

136
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,984
what you'd say is there's
two different things

137
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:57,255
causing an ultimate change to f.

138
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:58,727
So if you put these together, and you

139
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:01,363
want to know what the
total change in f is -

140
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:02,927
so I might go over here and say

141
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:06,923
the total change in f,
one of them is caused

142
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:10,778
by partial f, partial x
- and I can multiply it

143
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:13,119
by dx here, but really, we know that dx,

144
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:16,327
the change there was in turn caused by dt

145
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:19,532
so that in turn is caused by the change

146
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:22,684
in the x component that was due to dt.

147
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:25,184
That was of course of size dt.

148
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,439
And then for similar
reasons, the other way

149
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,439
that this changes in the y direction

150
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:35,389
is a partial of f with respect to y

151
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,997
but what caused that initial shift in y,

152
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:43,164
you'd say that was a shift
in y that was due to t,

153
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:48,158
and that size is dy dt times
dt, you could think of it.

154
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,192
So slight nudge in t causes a change in y,

155
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:53,229
that change in y causes the change in f

156
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,035
and when you add those two together that's

157
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,016
everything that's going
on, that's everything

158
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,398
that influences the ultimate change in f.

159
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:00,908
So then if you take this whole expression

160
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:03,107
and you divide everything out by dt

161
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:06,774
so you know, kind of
erase it from this side

162
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,992
and put it over here, dt,

163
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:12,920
this is your multi-variable chain rule,

164
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,064
and of course I've just
written the same thing again

165
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:17,144
but hopefully this gives
a little bit on intuition

166
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,275
for how you're composing different nudges

167
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:22,565
and why you wanna think about it that way.

168
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:23,772
Of course, you can see this, and you see

169
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:26,592
the partial f kind of
cancels out with that dx

170
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:29,234
and this partial y kind of
cancels out with that dy

171
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:31,346
and you're left with
the two different things

172
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:32,970
that constitute a change in x,

173
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,913
you know this one is only
partially the change in f,

174
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,818
this is also partially the change in f,

175
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:39,497
but together they give
the ultimate change in f

176
00:07:39,497 --> 00:07:41,033
and I think that gives
a very strong reason,

177
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:45,200
if you break it down like
that, why this should be true.
