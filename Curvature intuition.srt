00:00:00,412 --> 00:00:01,956
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,956 --> 00:00:06,123
So what I would like to do
here, is talk about curvature.

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:10,536
And, I've drawn on the X Y
plane here, a certain curve.

4
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:11,976
So this is our X-axis.

5
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:13,276
This is our Y-axis.

6
00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:15,075
And this is a curve running through space.

7
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:16,493
And I'd like you to imagine that this

8
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:19,394
is a road of some kind,
and you are driving on it.

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,718
And you are at a certain point,

10
00:00:20,718 --> 00:00:22,378
so let's say this point right here.

11
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:25,710
And if you imagine, what it
feels like to drive along

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,568
this road, and where you need to have your

13
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:29,948
steering wheel, you're turning
it a little bit to the right.

14
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:31,178
Not a lot, because it's kind of

15
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:33,431
a gentle curve at this point,
you're not curving a lot.

16
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:34,812
But the steering wheel isn't straight,

17
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:36,333
you are still turning on the road.

18
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,876
And now, imagine that your
steering wheel's stuck.

19
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:40,768
That it's not gonna move.

20
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:42,150
And however you're turning it,

21
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,814
you're stuck in that situation.

22
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:45,459
What's gonna happen, hopefully you're on

23
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:46,968
an open field or something,
because your car is

24
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:50,056
going to trace out some kind of circle.

25
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:50,889
Right?

26
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:53,655
You know your steering wheel
can't do anything different,

27
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:56,396
you're just turning it a certain rate,

28
00:00:56,396 --> 00:01:00,018
and that's gonna have you
tracing out some giant circle.

29
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,818
And this depends on where you are, right?

30
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:04,069
If you had been at a
different point on the curve,

31
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,428
where the curve was rotating a lot,

32
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:08,853
let's say you were back a
little bit towards the start.

33
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:12,208
At the start here, you have
to turn the steering wheel

34
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,141
to the right, but you're
turning it much more

35
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,851
sharply to stay on this part of the curve,

36
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:21,415
than you were to be on this
relatively straight part.

37
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,550
And the circle that you draw
as a result, is much smaller.

38
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,210
And this turns out to be a pretty nice way

39
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,357
to think about a measure, for just how

40
00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:30,365
much the curve actually curves.

41
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:31,910
And one way you could do this,

42
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,064
is you can think, "Okay,
what is the radius

43
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:36,233
of that circle, the circle you would trace

44
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,389
out if your steering wheel
locked at any given point.".

45
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,698
And if you kind of follow the point,

46
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:43,149
along different parts of the curve,

47
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,832
and see, "Oh, what's the different circle

48
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:46,539
that my car would trace out if

49
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,176
it was stuck at that point.".

50
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,533
You would get circles of
varying different radii.

51
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:51,369
Right?

52
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:55,620
And this radius actual
has a very special name.

53
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,253
I will call this "R".

54
00:01:57,253 --> 00:02:00,713
This is called the "Radius of Curvature".

55
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:02,329
And you can kind of see how this is a good

56
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:05,829
way to describe, how much you are turning.

57
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,398
You may have heard with a car,

58
00:02:09,398 --> 00:02:11,939
descriptions of the turning radius.

59
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,020
You know, if you have a car with a very

60
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,566
good turning radius, it's very small,

61
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,363
'cause what that means if you turned

62
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:17,803
it all the way you could trace out

63
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,440
just a very small circle.

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,437
But a car with a bad turning radius,

65
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,202
you know, you don't turn very much at all,

66
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:25,304
so you'd have to trace
out a much larger circle.

67
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:28,102
And, curvature itself isn't this "R".

68
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:30,984
It's not the radius of curvature.

69
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,817
But what it is, is it's the reciprocal

70
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:34,067
of that, it's one over "R".

71
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:38,093
And there is a special symbol for it.

72
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:39,847
It's kind of a "K", and I'm not sure in

73
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:41,645
handwriting I am going to distinguish

74
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,828
it from an actual "K", maybe
give it a little curly there.

75
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:45,767
It's the Greek letter Kappa.

76
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,253
And this is curvature.

77
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:48,704
And I want you to think for a second,

78
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,003
why we would take one over "R".

79
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,733
"R" is a perfectly fine description

80
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,706
of how much the road curves.

81
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:57,261
But why is it that you would think

82
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:01,360
one divided by "R", instead of "R" itself?

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,507
And the reason basically, is you want

84
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,759
curvature to be a measure
of, how much it curves

85
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,943
in the sense that, more sharp turns

86
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:09,521
should give you a higher number.

87
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,459
So, if you're at a point,
where you are turning

88
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,560
the steering wheel a lot, you want that

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,580
to result in a much higher number.

90
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,519
But, radius of curvature
will be really small,

91
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:19,842
when you are turning a lot.

92
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:21,549
But if you are at a point that's basically

93
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,093
a straight road, you
know, there's some slight

94
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,067
curve to it, but it's
basically a straight road,

95
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,702
you want the curvature to
be a very small number.

96
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:30,268
But in this case, the radius
of curvature is very large.

97
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,928
So it's pretty helpful to just have

98
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:34,761
one divided by "R", as the measure

99
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:38,849
of how much the road is turning.

100
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,530
And, in the next video,
I am going to go ahead

101
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,912
and start describing a little bit more

102
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:45,350
mathematically, how we capture this value.

103
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,045
'Cause as a loose
description, if you are just

104
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:49,506
kind of drawing pictures,
it's perfectly fine

105
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:50,690
to say, "Oh yeah, you
imagine a circle that's

106
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,071
kind of closely hugging the curve,

107
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:54,672
it's what your steering wheel would do

108
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:55,624
if you were locked.".

109
00:03:55,624 --> 00:03:58,771
But in math, we will describe
this curve parametrically.

110
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,357
It'll be the output of a
certain vector valued function.

111
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:04,169
And I wanna know how you
could capture this idea.

112
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:08,105
This, one over "R" curvature
idea, in a certain formula.

113
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:10,934
And that's what the next few
videos are going to cover.
