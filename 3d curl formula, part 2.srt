1
00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:02,331
- [Voiceover] So I'm
explaining the formula for

2
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:04,221
three-dimensional curl
and where we left off,

3
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:06,801
we have this determinant
of a three-by-three matrix,

4
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:07,955
which looks absurd because

5
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:09,215
none of the individual components

6
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:11,165
are actual numbers, but nevertheless,

7
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:12,324
I'm about show how when you kind of

8
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:14,415
go through the motions
of taking a determinant,

9
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,104
you get a vector-valued function

10
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:18,663
that corresponds to the curl.

11
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:20,736
So let me show you what I mean by that.

12
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,303
If you're computing the determinant,

13
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,825
of the guy that we have pictured

14
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:25,977
there in the upper-right,

15
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:28,743
you start by taking this
upper-left component,

16
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:31,037
and then multiplying it by the determinant

17
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:33,678
of the sub-matrix, the sub-matrix whose

18
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:35,446
rows are not the row of I and

19
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,864
whose columns are not the row of I.

20
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:39,346
So what that looks like over here,

21
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:41,397
is we're gonna take that unit vector I,

22
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:44,446
and then multiple it by a
certain little determinant,

23
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:46,537
and what this sub-determinant involves

24
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:49,626
is multiplying this
partial-partial Y by R,

25
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:51,577
which means taking the partial derivative

26
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:54,933
with respect to Y of the
multi-variable function R

27
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,024
and then subtracting off
the partial derivative

28
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,136
with respect to Z of Q.

29
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,716
So we're subtracting
off partial derivative

30
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:06,477
with respect to Z of the
multi-variable function Q,

31
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:09,437
and then that,

32
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,020
so that's the first thing that we do,

33
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,260
and then as a second part,

34
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,799
we take this J and we're
gonna subtract off,

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,485
so you're kind of thinking
plus, minus, plus,

36
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:19,128
for the elements in this top row,

37
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:21,648
so we're gonna subtract off J,

38
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,167
multiplied by another sub-determinant,

39
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,607
and then this one is gonna involve,

40
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,395
you know, this column
that it's not part of

41
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:29,917
and this column that it's not part of,

42
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:32,719
and you imagine those guys
as a two-by-two matrix,

43
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,125
and its determinant involves taking the

44
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,927
partial derivative with respect to X of R,

45
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:38,898
so that's kind of the diagonal,

46
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,919
partial-partial X of R,

47
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,995
and then subtracting off
the partial derivative

48
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:47,066
with respect to Z of P,

49
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:51,350
so partial-partial Z of P,

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,091
and then that's just two out of three

51
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:57,344
of the things we need to do
for our overall determinant,

52
00:01:57,344 --> 00:01:58,931
because the last part we're gonna add,

53
00:01:58,931 --> 00:02:03,114
we're gonna add that
top-right component, K,

54
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:06,752
multiplied by the sub-matrix whose

55
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,970
columns involve the
column it's not part of

56
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,623
and whose rows involve the
rows that it's not part of,

57
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:15,874
so K multiplied by the
determinant of this guy

58
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:17,844
is going to be, let's see,

59
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:19,774
partial-partial X of Q,

60
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:24,774
so that's partial-partial X of Q

61
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:28,796
minus partial-partial Y of P,

62
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:32,394
so partial derivative with respect to Y

63
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:35,277
of the multi-variable function P,

64
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:39,344
and that entire expression is the

65
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:41,617
three-dimensional curl of the function

66
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:44,948
whose components are P, Q, and R.

67
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:46,575
So here we have our vector function,

68
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:48,404
vector-valued function V whose

69
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:50,193
components are P, Q, and R,

70
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:51,574
and when you go through this whole process

71
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:53,524
of imagining the cross-product between

72
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:55,921
the Del operator, this Nabla symbol,

73
00:02:55,921 --> 00:03:00,471
and the vector output P, Q, and R,

74
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,092
what you get is this whole expression,

75
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:06,342
and, you know, here we're
writing with I, J, K notation,

76
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:09,492
if you're writing it as a column vector,

77
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:11,442
I guess I didn't erase some of these guys,

78
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,478
but if you're writing
this as a column vector,

79
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:16,219
it would look like saying the curl

80
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,331
of your vector valued function V

81
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,689
as a function of X, Y, and Z

82
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:24,681
is equal to,

83
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:26,237
and then what I'd put in
for this first component

84
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:27,270
would be what's up there,

85
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,007
so that would be your partial
with respect to Y of R

86
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:34,200
minus partial of Q with respect to Z,

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,740
so partial of Q with respect to Z,

88
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,912
and I won't copy it down
for all of the other ones

89
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:39,890
but in principle, you know,

90
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,203
you'd kind of, whatever
this J component is,

91
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:43,342
and I guess we're subtracting it

92
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:45,030
so you'd subtract there,

93
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,791
you'd copy that as the next
component and then over here.

94
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,621
But often times when
you're computing curl,

95
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:52,302
you kinda switch to
using this IJK notation.

96
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:54,091
My personal preference,
I typically default

97
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:55,920
to column vectors and other people

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,744
will write in terms of I, J, and K,

99
00:03:57,744 --> 00:03:59,044
it doesn't really matter as long as

100
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:01,872
you know how to go back
and forth between the two.

101
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:03,373
One really quick thing
that I wanna highlight

102
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:05,021
before doing an example of this

103
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:08,595
is that the K-component here,

104
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:10,544
the Z-component of the output,

105
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:12,943
is exactly the
two-dimensional curl formula.

106
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:15,422
If you kind of look back
to the videos on 2-D curl

107
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,581
and what its formula is,

108
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:18,043
that is what we have here.

109
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:19,242
And in fact all the other components

110
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:20,830
kind of look like mirrors of that

111
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,760
but you're using slightly
different operators

112
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,463
and slightly different functions

113
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:25,642
but if you think about rotation

114
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:27,553
that happens purely in the XY plane,

115
00:04:27,553 --> 00:04:29,160
just two-dimensional rotation,

116
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,315
and how in three dimensions that's

117
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:32,834
described with a vector in the K direction

118
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,421
and again, if that
doesn't quite seem clear,

119
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,124
maybe look back at the video on

120
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:38,341
describing rotation with
a three-dimensional vector

121
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:39,521
and the right-hand rule,

122
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:42,322
but vector is pointing
in the pure Z direction,

123
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:44,560
describe rotation in the XY plane,

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,283
and what's happening with these other guys

125
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:47,684
is kind of similar, right?

126
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:50,714
Rotation that happens
purely in the XZ plane

127
00:04:50,714 --> 00:04:52,704
is gonna correspond with a rotation vector

128
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:54,170
in the Y direction, the direction

129
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,730
perpendicular to the X, let's see, so

130
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,721
the XZ plane over here.

131
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,711
And then similarly this first component

132
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:02,294
kind of tells you all
the rotation happening

133
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:04,773
in the YZ plane and the vectors

134
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:08,104
in the I direction, the X
direction of the output,

135
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:11,213
kind of corresponds to
rotation in that plane.

136
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:12,372
Now when you compute it,

137
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:13,471
you're not always thinking about

138
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:14,912
oh, you know, this corresponds to

139
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:15,991
rotation in that plane and this

140
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:17,492
corresponds to rotation in that plane,

141
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:19,035
you're just kind of computing it to

142
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:20,012
get a formula out,

143
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:20,965
but I think it's kind of nice to

144
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:22,633
recognize that all the intuition

145
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:24,134
that we put into the two-dimensional curl

146
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:25,722
does show up here

147
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:27,673
and another thing I wanna emphasize

148
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:30,393
is this is not a formula to be memorized.

149
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:32,162
I would not, if I were you, try to

150
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:34,641
sit down and memorize
this long expression.

151
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:36,632
The only thing that you need to remember,

152
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:38,723
the only thing, is that curl is

153
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:41,404
represented as this Del cross V,

154
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:43,823
this Nabla symbol cross product with

155
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:45,451
a vector-valued function V,

156
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:47,300
because from there, whatever
your components are,

157
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,862
you can kind of go through the process

158
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,384
that I just did and the more you do it,

159
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,644
the quicker it becomes,

160
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,902
it's kind of long but it
doesn't take that long,

161
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:55,892
and it's certainly much
more fault-tolerant

162
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:57,459
than trying to remember something that

163
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:00,161
has as many moving parts as the formula

164
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:01,582
that you see here,

165
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:02,942
and in the next video I'll go through

166
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:04,041
an actual example of that.

167
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,374
I'll have functions for P, Q, and R

168
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,430
and walk through that process in

169
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,034
a more concrete context.

170
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:11,160
I'll see you then!
