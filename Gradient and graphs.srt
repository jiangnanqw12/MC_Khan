1
00:00:00,863 --> 00:00:01,803
- [Voiceover] So here I'd like to talk

2
00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:03,487
about what the gradient means

3
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:06,041
in the context of the graph of a function.

4
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:09,134
So in the last video,
I defined the gradient,

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,680
but let me just take a function here.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,521
And the one that I had graphed
is x-squared plus y-squared,

7
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:17,681
f of x, y, equals
x-squared plus y-squared.

8
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:19,886
So two-dimensional input,
which we think about

9
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,325
as being kind of the xy-plane,

10
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:24,530
and then a one-dimensional
output that's just the height

11
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,748
of the graph above that plane.

12
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:29,430
And I defined in the
last video, the gradient,

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,287
to be a certain operator.

14
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:33,168
An operator just means
you've taken a function

15
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:34,527
and you output another function,

16
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:37,545
and we use this upside down triangle.

17
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:40,483
So it gives you another
function that's also of x and y,

18
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:43,548
but this time it has a
vector valued output.

19
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:45,823
And the two components of its output

20
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:50,823
are the partial derivatives,
partial of f with respect to x,

21
00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:56,326
and the partial of f with respect to y.

22
00:00:58,154 --> 00:01:01,173
So for a function like this,
we actually evaluated it.

23
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:03,020
Let's take a look.

24
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,010
The first one is taking the derivative

25
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,553
with respect to x, so
it looks at x and says,

26
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:10,207
"You look like a variable to me.

27
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:13,748
"I'm gonna take your derivative, your 2x."

28
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:18,029
2x, but the y component
just looks like a constant

29
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:20,073
as far as the partial x is concerned.

30
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:22,789
And the derivative of a constant is zero.

31
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:24,113
But when you take the partial derivative

32
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:26,005
with respect to y, things reverse.

33
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:27,364
It looks at the x component and says,

34
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:28,443
"You look like a constant.

35
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:29,872
"Your derivative is zero."

36
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:31,353
But it looks at the y component and says,

37
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:32,874
"Ah, you look like a variable.

38
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:36,636
"Your derivative is 2y."

39
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:38,586
So this ultimate function
we get, the gradient,

40
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:40,595
which takes in a two variable input, xy,

41
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:41,767
some point on this plane,

42
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,149
but outputs a vector,

43
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,448
can nicely be visualized
with a vector field.

44
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:46,876
And I have another video on vector fields

45
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:48,130
if you're feeling unsure.

46
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,893
But I want you to just take a
moment, pause if you need to,

47
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:54,387
and guess, or try to think
about what vector field

48
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:55,351
this will look like.

49
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:56,210
I'm gonna show you in a moment,

50
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,232
but what's it gonna look like,

51
00:01:57,232 --> 00:02:01,295
the one that takes in
xy and outputs 2x, 2y?

52
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:02,189
Alright, have you done it,

53
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,835
have you thought about
what it's gonna look like?

54
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,414
Here's what we get.

55
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:10,630
It's a bunch of vectors
pointing away from the origin.

56
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,290
And the basic reason for that

57
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,716
is that if you have any given input point,

58
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:18,208
and say it's got coordinates x, y,

59
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,855
then the vector that that
input point represents

60
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:22,812
would, you know, if it
went from the origin here,

61
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:24,194
that's what that vector looks like,

62
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:26,655
but the output is two times that vector.

63
00:02:26,655 --> 00:02:29,627
So when we attach that
output to the original point,

64
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,787
we get something that's two
times that original vector

65
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:33,296
but pointing in the same direction,

66
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:34,770
which is away from the origin.

67
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,789
We kind of drew it poorly here.

68
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,805
And of course, when we draw vector fields,

69
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:41,603
we don't usually draw them to scale.

70
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:43,101
You scale them down

71
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,680
just so that things
don't look as cluttered.

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,479
That's why everything here,
they all look the same length,

73
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,023
but color indicates length.

74
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:50,183
So you should think of these
red guys as being really long,

75
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:52,365
the blue ones as being really short.

76
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,303
So what does this have to do
with the graph of the function?

77
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:57,718
There's actually a really
cool interpretation.

78
00:02:57,718 --> 00:03:00,725
So imagine that you are just
walking along this graph,

79
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:03,198
you know, you're a hiker
and this is a mountain.

80
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:06,239
And you picture yourself at
any old point on this graph,

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,281
let's say, what color should I use?

82
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,859
Let's say you're sitting
at a point like this.

83
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,751
And you say, "What direction should I walk

84
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,760
"to increase my altitude the fastest?"

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,896
You want to get uphill
as quickly as possible.

86
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:19,022
And from that point,

87
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:22,551
you might walk what looks
like straight up there.

88
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:23,704
You certainly wouldn't go around,

89
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,388
and this way you wouldn't go down.

90
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:27,571
So you might go straight up there.

91
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:31,088
And if you project your point
down onto the input space,

92
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:34,223
so this is the point above which you are,

93
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:37,462
that vector, the one
that's gonna get you going

94
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:40,191
uphill the fastest, the
direction you should walk.

95
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:41,688
For this graph, it should
kind of make sense,

96
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,685
is directly away from the origin,

97
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:45,090
'cause here, I'll erase this

98
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,046
'cause once I start moving
things, that won't stick.

99
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:51,529
If you were to look at
things from the very bottom,

100
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:53,967
any point that you are on the
mountain on the graph here

101
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,987
and when you want to increase the fastest,

102
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,984
you should just go directly
away from the origin

103
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,725
'cause that's when it's the steepest.

104
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:01,130
And all of these vectors are also pointing

105
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,872
directly away from the origin.

106
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:05,612
So people will say the gradient
points in the direction

107
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:10,413
of steepest ascent, that might
even be worth writing down.

108
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,916
Direction of steepest ascent.

109
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:20,031
And let's just see what that looks like

110
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:21,889
in the context of another example.

111
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:24,652
So I'll pull up another graph here,

112
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:27,044
pull up another graph
and its vector field.

113
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:28,971
So this graph, it's all negative values,

114
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:30,608
it's all below the xy-plane,

115
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,907
and it's got these two different peaks.

116
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,567
And I've also drawn the gradient field,

117
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,141
which is the word for the vector field

118
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:38,800
representing the gradient on top.

119
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,424
And you'll notice near the peak

120
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:43,850
all of the vectors are pointing

121
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,267
kind of in the uphill direction,

122
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:48,100
sort of telling you to go
towards that peak in some way.

123
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,188
And as you get a feel
around, you can see here,

124
00:04:51,188 --> 00:04:53,905
this very top one, like the
point that it's stemming from

125
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:56,470
corresponds with something
just a little bit shy

126
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,864
of the peak there.

127
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,302
And everybody's telling you to go uphill.

128
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:02,508
Each vector is telling
you which way to walk

129
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:05,004
to increase the altitude
on the graph the fastest.

130
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,268
It's the direction of steepest ascent.

131
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:08,731
And that's what the direction means,

132
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:11,041
but what does the length mean?

133
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:11,589
Well, if you take a look,

134
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:13,609
take a look at these red vectors here.

135
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:16,441
So red means that they should
be considered very, very long.

136
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,490
And the graph itself,

137
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,901
the point they correspond to on the graph

138
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,247
is just way off screen for us

139
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:22,629
because this graph gets really steep

140
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:24,765
and really negative very fast.

141
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:26,367
So the points these correspond to

142
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,364
have really, really steep slopes

143
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:29,892
whereas these blue ones over here,

144
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:31,738
you know, it's kind of a
relatively shallow slope.

145
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:33,421
By the time you're getting to the peak,

146
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:35,082
things start leveling off.

147
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:37,113
So the length of the gradient vector

148
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:38,599
actually tells you the steepness

149
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,840
of that direction of steepest ascent.

150
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,351
But one thing I want to point out here,

151
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:46,343
it doesn't really make sense
immediately looking at it,

152
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:49,415
why just throwing the partial
derivatives into a vector

153
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:53,106
is gonna give you this
direction of steepest ascent.

154
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,152
Ultimately it will.

155
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:55,064
We're gonna talk through that

156
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:57,583
and I hope to make that
connection pretty clear,

157
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,346
but unless you're some
kind of intuitive genius,

158
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:03,806
I don't think that connection
is at all obvious at first.

159
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:05,281
But you will see it in due time.

160
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,100
It's gonna require something

161
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,620
called the directional derivative.

162
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,173
See you next video.
