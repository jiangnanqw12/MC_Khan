1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
in the last video we were given a

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,359
multivariable function and asked to find

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,360
and classify all of its critical points

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,679
so critical points just means finding

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,360
where the gradient is equal to zero and

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,920
we found four different points for that

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,000
i have them down here they were 0 0 0

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,000
negative 2 square root of 3 and 1 and

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,960
negative square root of 3 and 1.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,600
so then

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
the next step is to classify those and

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,960
that requires the second partial

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,840
derivative test so what i'm going to go

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,920
ahead and do is a copy down the partial

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,360
derivatives since we already computed

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,280
those

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,719
copy

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,079
and then just kind of paste them down

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,840
here

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,200
where we can start to

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,440
use them for the second partial

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,399
derivatives

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,000
so

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,280
let me clean things up a little bit and

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,520
we don't need don't need this

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,360
simplification of it

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,640
so we've got our partial derivatives now

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,640
since we know we want to apply the

29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,320
second partial derivative test uh we've

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
got to first just compute all of the

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,120
different second partial derivatives of

32
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,960
our function that's just kind of the

33
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,280
first thing to do so let's go ahead and

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,000
do it the second partial derivative of

35
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,600
the function with respect to x twice in

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,360
a row we'll take

37
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,439
the partial derivative with respect to x

38
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,360
and then do it with respect to x again

39
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,840
so this first term looks like six times

40
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,119
a variable times a constant so it'll

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,040
just be six times that constant

42
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,560
and then the second term the derivative

43
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,400
of negative six x is just negative six

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,880
moving right along when we do the second

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,880
partial derivative with respect to y

46
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,159
twice in a row

47
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,079
we take the partial derivative with

48
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,240
respect to y and then do it again so

49
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,759
this x squared term looks like nothing

50
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,840
looks like a constant as far as y is

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,119
concerned so we ignore it the derivative

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,320
of negative 3y squared is negative 6

53
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,479
times y

54
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,200
and then the derivative of negative 6y

55
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,960
is just negative 6. and then we can't

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
forget that last crucially important

57
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,320
mixed partial derivative term

58
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,399
which is the partial derivative of f

59
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,079
where first we do it with respect to x

60
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,360
and then with respect to y the order

61
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,119
doesn't really matter in this case since

62
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560
it's a perfectly ordinary polynomial

63
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,079
function

64
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,200
so we could do it either way but i'm

65
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,800
just going to choose to take a look at

66
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,080
this guy and differentiate it with

67
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,599
respect to y

68
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,599
so the derivative of the first term with

69
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,599
respect to y is 6 x

70
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,959
6 x

71
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,800
and then that second term looks like a

72
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,200
constant with respect to y so that's all

73
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
we have

74
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,879
so now what we're going to do is plug in

75
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
each of the critical points to the

76
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,480
special second partial derivative test

77
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
expression and to remind you of what

78
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,239
that is

79
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
that expression is

80
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,200
we take the second partial derivative

81
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,040
with respect to x twice and i'll just

82
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,160
write it with a kind of shorter notation

83
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,440
using subscripts and we multiply that by

84
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,640
the second partial derivative with

85
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,879
respect to x and then we subtract off

86
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,319
subtract off the mixed partial

87
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,080
derivative term

88
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,680
squared so let's go ahead and do that

89
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,920
for each of our points so when we do

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
this at the point 0 0

91
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,440
0 0

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,640
what we end up getting

93
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,560
plugging that into the partial

94
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,200
derivative with respect to x twice 6

95
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,680
times 0 is 0 so there's just negative 6

96
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
so that gives us negative six

97
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,280
multiplied by

98
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
when we plug it into this partial

99
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
derivative with respect to y squared

100
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,680
again that y goes to zero so we're left

101
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,599
with just negative six

102
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519
and then we subtract off the mixed

103
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,440
partial derivative term which in this

104
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,200
case is zero because when we plug in x

105
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,519
equals zero we get zero so we're

106
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,360
subtracting off zero squared

107
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,400
and that entire thing equals negative

108
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
six times negative six is thirty-six

109
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,440
thirty-six

110
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,959
and we'll get to analyzing what it means

111
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,239
that that's positive in just a moment

112
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,840
but let's just kind of get all of them

113
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,599
on the board so we can kind of start

114
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,920
doing this with all of them if we do

115
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,120
this with 0 and negative 2

116
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,319
0 and negative 2

117
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
then once we plug in y equals negative 2

118
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,200
to this expression this time i'll write

119
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,680
it out 6 times negative 2 minus 6 so

120
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,920
that's negative 12 minus 6 we'll get

121
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,760
negative 18

122
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,439
negative 18.

123
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,120
then when we plug it into the partial

124
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,159
derivative of f with respect to y

125
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
squared

126
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,799
again i'll kind of write it out we have

127
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,239
negative 6 times y is equal to negative

128
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,120
2

129
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,200
minus 6. so now we have negative six

130
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,079
times negative two so that's positive 12

131
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,000
minus six so that will be a positive six

132
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,199
that we plug in here

133
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
and then for the mixed partial

134
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,040
derivative again x is equal to zero so

135
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,120
the mixed partial derivative is just

136
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,520
going to look like zero when we do this

137
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,440
so we're subtracting off 0 squared and

138
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,280
we get negative 18 times 6 and geez

139
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,720
what's 18 times 6. so that's going to be

140
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:43,840
36 times 3 so that's the same as 90 plus

141
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,440
18 so i think that's 108 negative 108

142
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,720
and the specific sign the specific

143
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,240
magnitude won't matter it's going to be

144
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,320
the sign that's important and this is

145
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,639
this is definitely negative

146
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,720
so now kind of moving right along these

147
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,720
examples can take quite a while

148
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
if we plug in square root of 3 1

149
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
square root of 3

150
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,120
1

151
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,840
what we get

152
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,160
now instead of plugging in y equals

153
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,360
negative 2 we're plugging in y equals 1

154
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,600
so that'll be 6 times 1 minus 6 so the

155
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,039
whole thing is just 0.

156
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,039
and then for the partial derivative with

157
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,320
respect to y squared instead of plugging

158
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,320
in negative 2

159
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,680
now we're plugging in y equals 1.

160
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,840
so we have negative 6 times 1 minus 6 so

161
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,240
the whole thing is negative 12. so

162
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
negative 12.

163
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,639
and now for the mixed partial derivative

164
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
term

165
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,160
which is 6x x is equal to the square

166
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,919
root of 3 so now we're subtracting off

167
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,039
the square root of three

168
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,880
squared

169
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,320
so what that equals is this first part

170
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,120
is just entirely zero and we're

171
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,320
subtracting off three so that's negative

172
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,600
three

173
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,000
and then

174
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,360
we have square root of three uh no no we

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,919
don't that's what we just did now we

176
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,880
have negative square root of 3

177
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,160
1

178
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,759
and this will be very similar because

179
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,440
this first term just had a y and we

180
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,840
plugged in the y so it's also going to

181
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,360
be 0 for totally the same reasons and

182
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,199
same deal over here the value of y

183
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,720
didn't change so that's also going to be

184
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
negative 12. it doesn't really matter

185
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,160
because we're multiplying it by a zero

186
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,919
right and then over here now we're

187
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,360
plugging in negative square root of

188
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,800
three

189
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,120
and that's going to have the same square

190
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,560
so again we're just subtracting off 3.

191
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,880
so what does this second partial

192
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,680
derivative test tell us once we express

193
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,039
this term if it's greater than 0 we have

194
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,520
a max or a min

195
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,360
that's what the test tells us

196
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,960
and then if it's less than 0 if it's

197
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,720
less than zero we have a saddle point

198
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,080
so in this case the only term that's

199
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,759
greater than zero

200
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,759
is this first one

201
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,919
this first one and to analyze whether

202
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,479
it's a maximum or a minimum notice that

203
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,160
the partial derivative with respect to x

204
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,080
twice in a row or with respect to y

205
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,240
twice in a row was negative which

206
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,039
indicates a sort of negative concavity

207
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,199
meaning this corresponds to a maximum so

208
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,800
this guy

209
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,720
corresponds to

210
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,319
a local maximum

211
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,319
now all of the other three gave us

212
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,240
negative numbers so all of these other

213
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
three give us saddle points

214
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,039
saddle points

215
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,880
so the answer to the question the

216
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,319
original find and classify you know such

217
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,240
and such points

218
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,360
is that we found four different critical

219
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,280
points

220
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,919
oh let's see four different critical

221
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,000
points 0 0 0 negative 2 square root of 3

222
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,680
1 and negative square root of 3 1 and

223
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,560
all of them are saddle points except for

224
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,919
0 0 which is a local maximum and all of

225
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,440
that is something that we can tell

226
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,560
without even looking at the graph of the

227
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,919
function

228
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,919
and with that i will see you next video
