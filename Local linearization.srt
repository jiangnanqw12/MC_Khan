00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,402
- [Voiceover] In the last couple videos, I

2
00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:03,896
showed how you can take a function, ah,

3
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:06,379
just a function with two inputs,

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:09,015
and find the tangent plane to its graph,

5
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:10,328
and the way that you think about this,

6
00:00:10,328 --> 00:00:11,581
you first find a point,

7
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:12,994
some kind of input point,

8
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:14,757
which is, you know I'll just write

9
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:17,046
abstractly as x nought and y nought.

10
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:19,471
And you see where that
point ends up on the graph,

11
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:21,282
and you wanna find a new function,

12
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:23,462
a new function which we were calling L,

13
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:24,894
and maybe you say L sub f,

14
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:27,158
which also is a function of x and y.

15
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:28,657
And you want the graph of that function

16
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:31,135
to be a plane tangent to the graph.

17
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:33,428
Now this often goes by another name.

18
00:00:33,428 --> 00:00:36,481
This will go under the
name Local Linearization,

19
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:40,648
Local linearization, this is
kind of a long word, zation.

20
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:44,933
And what this basically means,

21
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,674
the word local means you're looking at

22
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:47,890
a specific input point.

23
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,893
So in this case,

24
00:00:48,893 --> 00:00:51,955
it's a specific input
point x nought, y nought,

25
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:54,232
and the idea of a linearization,

26
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:56,621
a linearization, means
you're approximating

27
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:58,676
the function with something simpler,

28
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:00,243
with something that's actually linear,

29
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:01,475
and I'll tell you what
I mean by linear in,

30
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:02,738
in just a moment.

31
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:05,997
But the whole idea here is that
we don't really care about,

32
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:08,939
you know, tangent planes
in an abstract 3D spaced

33
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,238
to some kind of graph.

34
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,620
The whole reason for doing this,

35
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,266
is that this is a really good
way to approximate a function,

36
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:16,393
which is potentially a
very complicated function

37
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:17,744
with something that's much easier,

38
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,114
something that has constant
partial derivatives.

39
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,147
Now my goal of this
video is gonna be to show

40
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:24,569
how we write this local linearization here

41
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:27,370
in vector form, because
it'll be both more compact,

42
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,907
and hopefully easier to remember,

43
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:30,136
and also it's more general.

44
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:32,071
It'll apply to things
that have more than just,

45
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:34,691
just two input variables
like this one does.

46
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:36,422
So just to remind us of where we were,

47
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:38,816
and what we got to in
the last couple videos,

48
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,579
I'll write a little bit
more abstractly this time,

49
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,345
rather than a specific example.

50
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:44,640
The way you do this local linearization

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,297
is first you find the partial derivative

52
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:47,801
of f with respect to x,

53
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:51,444
which I'll write with
the subscript notation.

54
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,679
And you evaluate that at x of o

55
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:55,964
or x nought, y nought.

56
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:57,177
You evaluate it at the point

57
00:01:57,177 --> 00:01:59,004
about which you're approximating

58
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:03,447
and then you multiply that
by x minus that constant.

59
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:04,806
So the only variable right here,

60
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:05,757
everything is a constant,

61
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:08,028
but the only variable part is that x.

62
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,007
And then we add to that,

63
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:10,502
basically doing the same thing with y.

64
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:12,713
You take the partial
derivative with respect to y,

65
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:14,749
you evaluate it at the input point,

66
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:17,083
the point about which you are linearizing,

67
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,750
and then you multiply
it by y minus ys of o.

68
00:02:22,214 --> 00:02:23,938
And then to this entire thing

69
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:25,720
because you wanna make sure that when

70
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,153
you evaluate this function
at the input point itself.

71
00:02:28,153 --> 00:02:30,457
You see, when you plug
in x nought and y nought,

72
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:31,585
this terms goes to zero,

73
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,449
cause x nought minus x nought is zero.

74
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:34,532
This terms goes to zero,

75
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:36,132
and this is the whole
reason we kind of paired

76
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:38,864
up these terms and organized
the constants in this way.

77
00:02:38,864 --> 00:02:40,518
This way, you can just think about adding

78
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:44,361
whatever the function itself
evaluates to at that point.

79
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,090
And this will ensure
that your linearization

80
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,212
actually equals the function itself

81
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:49,097
at the local point.

82
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,379
Cause hopefully if you're
approximating it near a point,

83
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,323
then at that point, it's actually equal.

84
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:56,250
So what do I mean by this word linear?

85
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,550
The word linear has a
very precise formulation,

86
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,731
especially in the context
of linear algebra,

87
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,363
and admittedly, this is not actually

88
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:04,709
a linear function in the technical sense.

89
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:05,828
But loosely what it means,

90
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:07,527
and the reason people call it linear,

91
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:10,059
is that this x term
here, this variable term,

92
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,869
doesn't have anything
fancy going on with it.

93
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,984
It's just being multiplied by a constant,

94
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:15,829
and similarly this y term it's just being

95
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:16,936
multiplied by a constant.

96
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:18,588
It's not squared, there's no square root,

97
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:20,939
it's not in an exponent
or anything like that.

98
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,000
And although there is a
more technical meaning

99
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,045
of the word linear,

100
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,497
this is all it really
needs in this context.

101
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,719
This is all you need to think about.

102
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,065
Each variable is just
multiplied by a constant.

103
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:32,306
Now you might see this in
a more complicated form,

104
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:36,148
or what's at first a more
complicated form using vectors.

105
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:37,593
So first of all, let's think about

106
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,975
how we would start describing

107
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:41,330
everything going on here with vectors.

108
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,638
So the input, ah,

109
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:45,070
rather than talk about the
input as being a pair of points,

110
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,583
what I wanna say is that
there's some vector,

111
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,165
some vector that has
these as its components,

112
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:51,207
and we just wanna capture that all,

113
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:52,696
and I wanna give that a name.

114
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:54,949
And kind of unfortunately
the name that we give this,

115
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:57,173
it's very common to just call it x,

116
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:59,009
and maybe a bold-faced x and that would be

117
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,689
easier to do typing than it is writing,

118
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,234
so I'll just kind of try
to emphasize bold-faced

119
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:03,681
x equals this vector,

120
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:05,213
and where's, that's confusing cause x

121
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:08,056
is already one of the input
variables that's just a number.

122
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:09,303
Um, but I'll try to emphasize it,

123
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:10,165
just making it bold.

124
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:11,555
You'll see this in writing a lot.

125
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,069
X is this input vector,

126
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,861
and then similarly, the specified, ah,

127
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:18,344
specified input about
which we are approximating,

128
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:20,330
you would call, see I'll make it a nice

129
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,196
bold-faced x nought.

130
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,829
We'll, we'll do that nought
to just kind of indicate

131
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,584
that it's a constant of some kind.

132
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:27,417
And what that is,

133
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,184
it's a vector containing the two numbers

134
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:30,434
x nought, y nought.

135
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:32,482
So this is just us
starting to write things

136
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,438
in a more vectorized way

137
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:36,093
and the convenience here is that,

138
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,248
that if you're dealing with a function

139
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:40,436
with three input variables
or four or a hundred,

140
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:41,790
you could still just write it as this

141
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,030
bold-faced x with the understanding

142
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,125
that the vector has a lot more components.

143
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,185
So now, let's take a look at,

144
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:51,645
at these first two terms
in our linearization.

145
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:53,695
We can start thinking of this as a,

146
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:55,874
as a dot product, actually.

147
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:57,462
So let me first just kind of move this guy

148
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:59,226
out of the way and give
ourselves some room.

149
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:01,457
So he's gonna just go up there,

150
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:03,114
this the same guy,

151
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:05,642
and now I wanna think about
writing this other term here

152
00:05:05,642 --> 00:05:07,319
as a, as a dot product.

153
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:10,004
And what that looks like is we have

154
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:10,837
the two partial derivatives fs of x

155
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:14,686
and fs of y, indicating
the partial derivatives

156
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,660
with respect to x and y,

157
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,517
and each one of them is evaluated.

158
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:19,666
Let's see, I'll do it, I'll do it

159
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,916
evaluating at our bold-faced x nought,

160
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:25,370
and then this one is also evaluated

161
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,128
at that bold-faced x nought.

162
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:29,141
So, really you're thinking
about this as being,

163
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,431
you know, a vector that contains
two different variables.

164
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,292
You're just packing it
into a single symbol,

165
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,860
and the dot product here

166
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,669
is against, ah, you
know, the first component

167
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:40,408
is x minus x nought,

168
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:44,295
so I'd write that as x
minus x nought the number,

169
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:45,720
and then similarly, y minus,

170
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,658
let's see, I'll do it in the same color,

171
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:49,158
y nought the number.

172
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,287
Ah, but we can write each one of these

173
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,965
in a more compact form,

174
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,605
where this, the vector that
has the partial derivatives,

175
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:59,164
that's the gradient, and
if that feels unfamiliar,

176
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:01,453
maybe go back and check out
the videos on the gradient,

177
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,014
but this whole vector is
basically just saying,

178
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:05,089
take the gradient and evaluate it at that,

179
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:08,924
that vector input, you know, x nought.

180
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:11,651
And in the second component here,

181
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:13,035
that's telling you you've got

182
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:16,026
x and y minus x nought and y nought.

183
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:17,729
So what you're basically doing is taking

184
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,501
the, you know, bold-faced input,

185
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:21,933
the variable vector x,

186
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,571
and then you're subtracting off,

187
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:28,499
you know, x nought, where x
nought is some kind of constant.

188
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:29,379
So this right here,

189
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,416
this is just vector terms
where you're thinking of this

190
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,872
as being a vector with two components,

191
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,872
and this one is a vector
with two components,

192
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:35,705
but if your function happened to

193
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,009
be something more complicated,

194
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,343
with, you know, a hundred input variables,

195
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:40,914
this would be the same
thing you write down.

196
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:43,067
You would just understand
that when you expand this,

197
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:43,900
there's gonna be a hundred different

198
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,740
components in the vector.

199
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,860
Um, and this is what a linear term

200
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,605
looks like in vector terminology,

201
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:51,322
cause this dot product is telling you

202
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:52,878
that all of the components

203
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:54,218
of that bold-faced x vector,

204
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:56,536
the, that expands into, you know,

205
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:59,777
not bold-faced x, y, z,
whatever else it expands to.

206
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,372
All of those are just being multiplied

207
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:03,547
by some kind of constant.

208
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:04,681
So we take that whole thing,

209
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:08,317
that's, that's how you simplify
the first couple terms here,

210
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:10,008
and of course, we just add on

211
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,739
the value of the function itself.

212
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:14,103
So you would take that as the linear term.

213
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:15,937
And no, I kind of like to
add it on to the front,

214
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,406
actually, where you think about taking

215
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:19,420
the function itself and evaluating it

216
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,210
at that, that constant input x nought,

217
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,008
cause that way you can kind of think

218
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:28,184
this is your constant term,
this is your constant term,

219
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:31,274
and then the rest of the stuff
here is your linear term.

220
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:32,299
Rest of your stuff is your linear.

221
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:34,357
Cause later on if we
start adding other terms

222
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:35,280
like a quadratic term

223
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,344
or more complicated things,

224
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:38,299
you can kind of keep
adding them on the end.

225
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:39,536
So this right here,

226
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:41,083
is the expression that you will often see

227
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,279
for the local linearization.

228
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,839
And the only place where the
actual variable shows up,

229
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,801
the variable vector, is
right here, is this guy.

230
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,539
Cause, you know, when
you evaluate the function

231
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,976
f at a specified input,
that's just a constant.

232
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:54,662
when you evaluate the
gradient at that input,

233
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:55,768
it's just a constant.

234
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,777
And we're subtracting off that, that

235
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,868
um, specified input
that's just a constant.

236
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:02,269
So this is the only place
where your variable shows up.

237
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:03,657
So once all is said and done,

238
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,178
and once you do your computations,

239
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:07,208
this is a very simple function.

240
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,406
And the, the important part
is maybe this is much simpler

241
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,054
than the function f itself,

242
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:12,749
which allows you to, you know,

243
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:14,539
maybe compute something more quickly

244
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,064
if you're writing a program that needs to,

245
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,314
you know, deal with some
kind of complicated function,

246
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:21,301
but runtime is an issue or maybe,

247
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,101
it's a function that you
never knew in the first place,

248
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:25,700
but you were able to approximate
its value at a point,

249
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,207
and approximate its gradient.

250
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,647
So this is what lets you approximate

251
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:30,758
the function as a whole near that point.

252
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:32,318
So again, this might look very abstract,

253
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:34,235
but if you just kind of unravel everything

254
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:35,693
and think back to where it came from

255
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,657
and look at, look at the specific example

256
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:39,382
of a, you know, tangent plane, um,

257
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:41,478
hopefully it all makes
a little bit of sense

258
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:44,007
and you see that this is
really just the simplest

259
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:47,417
possible function that
evaluates to the same value

260
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,436
as f when you input this point,

261
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:51,554
and whose partial derivatives all evaluate

262
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:53,197
to the same values as those of f

263
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:55,028
at that specified point.

264
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:56,510
And if you wanna see
more examples of this,

265
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,998
and what it looks like and
maybe how you can use it

266
00:08:57,998 --> 00:09:00,047
to approximate certain functions,

267
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:01,673
I have an article on that,
that you can go check out,

268
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:03,780
and it would be
particularly good to kind of

269
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,846
go in with a piece of paper

270
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:07,476
and sort of work through
the examples yourself

271
00:09:07,476 --> 00:09:09,489
as you, as you work through it.

272
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:10,609
And with that said,

273
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:12,097
I will see you next video.
