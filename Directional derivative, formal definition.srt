1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:02,438
- [Voiceover] So I have written
here the formal definition

2
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:04,187
for the partial derivative of

3
00:00:04,187 --> 00:00:08,014
a two-variable function
with respect to X, and what

4
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:10,327
I wanna do is build up
to the formal definition

5
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:13,086
of the directional derivative
of that same function

6
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:16,121
in the direction of some
vector V, and you know,

7
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:17,555
V with the little thing on top,

8
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:20,246
this will be some vector in
the input space, and I have

9
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:22,086
another video on the formal definition

10
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:23,610
of the partial derivative if you want to

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,940
check that out, and just to
really quickly go through here,

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,227
I've drawn this diagram before,

13
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,933
but it's worth drawing again, if you

14
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:33,200
think of your input space,
which is the X Y plane,

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,917
and you think of it
somehow mapping over to

16
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:36,461
the real number line, which is where

17
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:38,899
your output F lives,
and when you're taking

18
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,764
the partial derivative at
a point A B, you're looking

19
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:43,612
over here and you say,
maybe that's your point,

20
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:47,171
some point A B, and you imagine nudging it

21
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:49,128
slightly in the X direction, and saying,

22
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:51,285
hey, how does that influence the function?

23
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,407
So, maybe this is where
A B lands, and maybe

24
00:00:53,407 --> 00:00:55,572
the result is a nudge that's
a little bit negative.

25
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,782
That would be a negative
partial derivative, and you

26
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:01,379
think of the size of that nudge
as partial X, and the size

27
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,730
of the resulting nudge in the
output space as partial F.

28
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,434
So, the way that you read
this formal definition

29
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,616
is you think of this
variable H, you know, people,

30
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:12,420
you could say delta X, but H seems to be

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,020
the common variable people
use, you think of it

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,093
as that change in your input space,

33
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:21,314
that slight nudge, and you
look at how that influences

34
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:24,183
the function when you only
change the X component here,

35
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,789
you know, you're only
changing the X component

36
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:28,288
with that nudge, and you
say what's the change in F?

37
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,022
What's that partial F?

38
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:32,412
So, I'm gonna write this in
a slightly different way,

39
00:01:32,412 --> 00:01:34,323
using vector notation.

40
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:37,241
Instead I'm gonna say,
you know, partial F,

41
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:41,566
partial X, and instead of
saying the input is A B,

42
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:44,816
I'm gonna say it's a, you know,

43
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:46,996
just A, and then make it clear that that's

44
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:49,315
a vector, and this will be
a two-dimensional vector,

45
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:51,169
so I'll put that little arrow on top

46
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,948
to indicate that it's a
vector, and if we rewrite

47
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,211
this definition, we'd be thinking

48
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:58,628
the limit, as H goes to zero,

49
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:02,096
of

50
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:05,711
something divided by H, but that thing,

51
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:06,855
now that we're writing in terms of

52
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:09,688
vector notation, is gonna be F of,

53
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:14,051
so it's gonna be our
original starting point A,

54
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,636
but plus what?

55
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,322
I mean, up here, it was
clear we could just add it

56
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:19,354
to the first component, but
if I'm not writing in terms

57
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:21,403
of components, and I
have to think in terms of

58
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:24,566
vector addition, really what I'm adding

59
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:28,534
is that H times the
vector, the unit vector

60
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:30,411
in the X direction, and it's common

61
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:32,605
to use, you know, this little I with a hat

62
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:37,371
to represent the unit
vector in the X direction.

63
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:39,441
So when I'm adding these,
it's really the same.

64
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:40,884
You know, this H is only gonna go to

65
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:43,810
that first component, and the
second component is multiplied

66
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,560
by zero, and what we subtract off

67
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:49,101
is the value of the function at

68
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:51,496
that original input, that original

69
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,692
two-dimensional input
that I'm just thinking of

70
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:56,746
as a vector here, and
when I write it like this,

71
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:59,428
it's actually much clearer
how we might extend

72
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:02,357
this idea to moving in
different directions.

73
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:04,653
'Cause now, all of the information

74
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:06,305
about what direction you're moving

75
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:09,505
is captured with this vector here,

76
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:13,410
what you multiply your nudge
by as you're adding the input.

77
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,646
So let's just rewrite that over here

78
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,615
in the context of directional derivative.

79
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,051
What you would say is that
the directional derivative

80
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:23,407
in the direction of
some vector, any vector,

81
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:26,784
of F, evaluated at a point,
and we'll think about

82
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:30,064
that input point as
being a vector itself, A.

83
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:32,326
Here, I'll get rid of this guy.

84
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:35,553
It's also gonna be a limit, and as always,

85
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:37,579
with these things, we think of some,

86
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,420
not, I mean, always, but with derivatives,

87
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,964
you think of some variable
as going to zero, and then

88
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:45,890
that's gonna be on the
denominator, and the change

89
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,950
in the function that we're looking for

90
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,639
is gonna be F, evaluated at
that initial input vector

91
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,806
plus H, that scaling value,
that little nudge of a value,

92
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:01,476
multiplied by the vector whose direction

93
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:03,691
we care about, and then you subtract off

94
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:06,858
the value of F at that original input.

95
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:12,130
So, this right here is
the formal definition

96
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,697
for the directional
derivative, and you see how

97
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:16,695
it's much easier to
write in vector notation,

98
00:04:16,695 --> 00:04:18,381
because you're thinking of your input

99
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:22,008
as a vector and your output as
just some nudge by something.

100
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:23,226
So, let's take a look at what that

101
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,567
would feel like over here.

102
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:27,066
You know, instead of
thinking of D X and a nudge

103
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:31,236
purely in the X direction,
and I'll erase these guys,

104
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:34,335
you would think of this point as being A,

105
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:36,835
as being a vector valued A, so

106
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:40,995
just to make clear how it's a vector,

107
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:42,677
you'd be thinking of it starting at

108
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:43,835
the origin, and the tip represents

109
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:47,052
that point, and then H times V, you know,

110
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,552
maybe V is some vector, often,

111
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:52,673
you know, a direction that's neither

112
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:55,386
purely X nor purely Y, but when you

113
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:59,874
scale it down, it'll just
be a tiny little nudge

114
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:03,417
that's gonna be H, that tiny little value,

115
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:06,804
scaling your vector V, so that
tiny little nudge, and what

116
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:09,648
you wonder is, hey,
what's the resulting nudge

117
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:10,786
to the output?

118
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:12,696
And the ratio between the size of that

119
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:15,917
resulting nudge to the output
and the original guy there

120
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,151
is your directional derivative,
and more importantly,

121
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,207
as you take the limit
for that original nudge

122
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:22,163
getting really really
small, that's gonna be

123
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:24,679
your directional derivative,
and you can probably anticipate

124
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:27,812
there's a way to interpret
this as the slope of a graph.

125
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:29,437
That's what I'm gonna
talk about next video,

126
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:31,627
but you actually have to
be a little bit careful,

127
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:34,294
because we call this the
directional derivative,

128
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:37,889
but notice, if you scale
the value V by two,

129
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,123
you know, if you go over here
and you start plugging in

130
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:42,909
two times V and seeing how
that influences things,

131
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:47,070
it'll be twice the change, because here,

132
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,979
even if you're scaling
by the same value H,

133
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,692
it's gonna double the initial
nudge that you had, and it's

134
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:56,623
gonna double the resulting nudge out here,

135
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,101
even though the denominator
H doesn't stay changed.

136
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:01,458
So when you're taking the
ratio, what you're considering

137
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,063
is the size of your initial nudge

138
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,923
actually might be influenced.

139
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:06,589
So, some authors, they'll actually change

140
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:08,702
this definition, and
they'll throw a little

141
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,214
absolute value of the original
vector, just to make sure

142
00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:14,660
that when you scale it by
something else, it doesn't

143
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,984
influence things, and you
only care about the direction.

144
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:18,312
But, I actually don't like that.

145
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,240
I think there's some
usefulness in the definition

146
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,798
as it is right here,
and that there's kind of

147
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:25,128
a good interpretation to be had,

148
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:27,982
for when, if you double
the size of your vector,

149
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:31,762
why that should double the
size of your derivative,

150
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,367
but I'll get to that in following videos.

151
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,419
This right here is the formal definition

152
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,940
to be thinking about, and
I'll see you next video.
