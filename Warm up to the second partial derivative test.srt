1
00:00:00,293 --> 00:00:01,837
- So in single variable calculus,

2
00:00:01,837 --> 00:00:04,517
if you have a function f
of x and you want to find

3
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:07,052
the maximum or the
minimum of this function,

4
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:10,228
what you do is you find its
derivative and you set that

5
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:11,671
equal to zero.

6
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:14,410
And graphically, this has
the interpretation that,

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,545
you know, if you have the graph
of f, setting its derivative

8
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:21,049
equal to zero means that
you're looking for places where

9
00:00:21,049 --> 00:00:23,027
its got a flat tangent line.

10
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:24,502
So in the graph that I drew,

11
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:26,648
it would be these two flat tangent lines.

12
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:29,018
And then once you find these
points, you know for example,

13
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:31,672
here you have one
solution that I'll call x1

14
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:35,897
and then here you have
another solution, x2,

15
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:38,921
you can ask yourself the
question are these maxima,

16
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:41,773
or are they minima, right?

17
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:45,478
Because both of these can
have flat tangent lines.

18
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,048
So when you do find this
and you want to understand

19
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,692
is it a maximum or a minimum,

20
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,447
if you're just looking at
the graph, we can tell.

21
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:54,470
You can tell that this point
here is a local maximum

22
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,377
and this point here is a local minimum.

23
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:58,075
But if you weren't looking at the graph

24
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:01,106
there's a nice test that
will tell you the answer.

25
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:04,300
You basically look for the
second, second derivative

26
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,841
and in this case because
the concavity is down,

27
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,735
that second derivative is
going to be less than zero,

28
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:12,888
and then over here, because
the concavity is up,

29
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:15,886
that second derivative
is greater than zero.

30
00:01:15,886 --> 00:01:18,301
And by getting this
information about the concavity

31
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:21,561
you can make a conclusion that
when the concavity is down,

32
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:24,416
you're at a local maximum,
when the concavity is up,

33
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,778
you're at a local minimum.

34
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:28,604
In the case where the second,
second derivative is zero,

35
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:29,538
it's undetermined.

36
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:32,053
You'd have to do more
tests to figure it out.

37
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:33,653
It's unknown.

38
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:35,325
So in the multi-variable world,

39
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:37,016
the situation is very similar.

40
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:39,618
As I've talked about in
previous videos, what you'd do

41
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:41,624
is you'd have some kind of function

42
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:43,594
and let's say it's a
two variable function,

43
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:45,965
and instead of looking for where
the derivative equals zero,

44
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:47,684
you're gonna be looking for where the

45
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:51,000
gradient of your function
is equal to the zero vector,

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,625
which we might make bold to
emphasize that that's a vector.

47
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,930
And that corresponds with
finding flat tangent planes.

48
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,036
If that seems unfamiliar,

49
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:00,485
go back and take a look at
the video where I introduce

50
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:03,604
the idea of multi-variable
maxima and minima.

51
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:05,452
But the subject of this
video is gonna be on

52
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:08,577
what is analogous to this
second derivative test,

53
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:10,610
where in the single variable
world, you just find the second

54
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,237
derivative and check if it's
greater than or less than zero.

55
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:15,038
How can we, in the multi-variable world,

56
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:16,795
do something similar to
figure out if you have

57
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:19,894
a local minimum, a local
maximum, or that new possibility

58
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:22,955
of a saddle point, that I
talked about in the last video?

59
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:24,321
So there is another test and it's called

60
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:26,356
the second partial derivative test.

61
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,472
I'll get to the specifics of that

62
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:29,643
at the very end of this video.

63
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:32,104
To set the landscape, I want
to actually talk through

64
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:34,144
a specific example where we're finding

65
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:35,739
when the gradient equals zero,

66
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,886
just to see what that looks like

67
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:39,557
and just to have some concrete
formulas to deal with.

68
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:42,247
So, the function that
you're looking at right now

69
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:45,747
is f of xy is equal to x to the fourth,

70
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:50,987
minus four x squared, plus y squared.

71
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:55,530
Okay, so that's the function
that we're dealing with.

72
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,570
In order to find where
its tangent plane is flat,

73
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,813
we're looking for where
the gradient equals zero.

74
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,932
And remember, this is just
really a way of unpacking

75
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,952
the requirements that
both partial derivatives,

76
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,756
the partial derivative
of f with respect to x,

77
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:12,096
at some point, and we'll
kind of write it in as we're

78
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:15,220
looking for the x and
y where this is zero,

79
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,561
and also where the partial
derivative of f with respect to y

80
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:22,894
at that same point, xy is equal to zero.

81
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:26,176
So the idea is that this is
gonna give us some kind of

82
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:29,157
system of equations that
we can solve for x and y.

83
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:30,796
So let's go ahead and actually do that.

84
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:33,978
In this case, the partial
derivative with respect to x,

85
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:36,577
we look up here and the only
places where x shows up,

86
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:38,989
we have x to the fourth
minus four x squared,

87
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,575
so that x to the fourth,
turns into four times x cubed,

88
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:48,452
minus four x squared, that
becomes minus eight x,

89
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:50,958
and then y, y just looks like a constant.

90
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,208
So we're adding a constant
and nothing changes here.

91
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,068
So the first requirement is

92
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,985
that this portion is equal to zero.

93
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:59,076
Now the second part, where we're looking

94
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:02,019
for the partial derivative
with respect to y,

95
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,920
the only place where y shows
up is this y squared term,

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,651
so the partial derivative with
respect to y is just two y.

97
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:11,424
And we're setting that equal to zero.

98
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:14,813
I chose a simple example
where these partial derivative

99
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:17,479
equations, you know this
one nicely only includes x

100
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:19,201
and this one nicely only includes y

101
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:20,323
but that's not always the case.

102
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:22,285
You can imagine if you
intermingle the variables

103
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:25,298
a little bit more, these
will actually intermingle Xs

104
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,583
and Ys and it'll be a
harder thing to solve.

105
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,145
But I just want something where we can

106
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,487
actually start to find the solutions.

107
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:35,654
So if we actually solve this
system, this equation here,

108
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:39,200
the two y equals zero,
just gives us the fact

109
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,395
that y has to equal zero.

110
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:42,945
So that's nice enough, right?

111
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:45,819
And then this second equation,
that four x cubed minus

112
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,558
eight x equals zero, let's
go ahead and rewrite that

113
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:50,178
where I'm going to
factor out one of the Xs

114
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:53,828
and factor out a four, so
this is four x multiplied

115
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:57,661
by x squared, minus
two, has to equal zero.

116
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:01,507
So there's two different ways

117
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,191
that this can equal zero, right?

118
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:05,058
Either x itself is equal to zero,

119
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:07,719
so that would be one
solution, x is equal to zero,

120
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:11,054
or x squared minus two
is zero, which would mean

121
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:13,572
x is plus or minus the square root of two.

122
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:17,739
So we have x is plus or
minus the square root of two.

123
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,025
So the solution to the
system of equations,

124
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:23,763
we know that no matter
what, y has to equal zero,

125
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:26,823
and then one of three
different things can happen.

126
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:28,910
X equals zero, x equals
positive square root of two,

127
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,827
or x equals negative square root of two.

128
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:33,195
So this gives us three separate solutions,

129
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:34,927
and I'll go ahead and write them down.

130
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:39,094
Our three solutions as ordered
pairs are gonna be either

131
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:43,606
zero, zero; for when x
is zero and y is zero.

132
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:46,439
You have square root of two, zero.

133
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:52,381
And then you have negative
square root of two, zero.

134
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:54,139
These are the three different points,

135
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,557
the three different values,

136
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:58,397
for x and y that satisfy
the two requirements

137
00:05:58,397 --> 00:06:00,886
that both partial derivatives are zero.

138
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:02,311
What that should mean on the graph then

139
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:04,337
is when we look at those
three different inputs,

140
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:06,363
all of those have flat tangent planes.

141
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:09,381
So the first one, zero, zero,
if we kind of look above,

142
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,828
I guess we're kind of
inside the graph here,

143
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,163
zero, zero, is right at the origin.

144
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,702
We can see, just looking at the graph,

145
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:17,589
that that's actually a saddle point.

146
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:19,469
You know, this is neither a local maximum

147
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:20,553
nor a local minimum.

148
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:23,276
It doesn't look like a
peak or like a valley.

149
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:25,814
Then the other two, where we
kind of move along the x axis,

150
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:28,215
and that guess it turns out
that this point here is directly

151
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:30,635
below x equals positive
square root of two,

152
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:33,617
and this other minimum is directly below

153
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:35,395
x equals negative square root of two.

154
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,979
I wouldn't have been able
to guess that just looking

155
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,968
at the graph but we just figured it out.

156
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:42,259
We can see visually that both
of those are local minima.

157
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,611
But the question is, how could
we have figured that out,

158
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,839
once we find these solutions,
if you didn't have the graph

159
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,557
to look at immediately, how
could you have figured out

160
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:51,869
that zero, zero corresponds
to a saddle point,

161
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,509
and that both of these other solutions

162
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:56,014
correspond to local minima?

163
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:57,889
Well following the idea
of the single variable

164
00:06:57,889 --> 00:06:59,110
second derivative test,

165
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,870
what you might do is take the
second partial derivatives

166
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,330
of our function and see how
that might influence concavity.

167
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,532
For example, if we take the
second partial derivative

168
00:07:07,532 --> 00:07:10,957
with respect to x, and I'll
try to squeeze it up here.

169
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:13,284
Second partial derivative of the function,

170
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:16,983
with respect to x, and
we're doing that twice,

171
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:19,926
we're taking the second
derivative of this expression,

172
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:22,978
with respect to x, so we
bring down that three,

173
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:26,561
and that's gonna become 12
because three times four

174
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:30,961
times x squared, 12 times
x squared minus eight,

175
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:31,961
minus eight.

176
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:35,995
So what this means, woah,
kind of moved that around.

177
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:38,092
What this means in terms
of the graph is that

178
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:39,962
if we move purely in the x direction,

179
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:41,812
which means we kind of
cut it with a plane,

180
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:43,989
representing a constant y value,

181
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:47,712
and we look at the slice
of the graph itself,

182
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:50,441
this expression will tell us the concavity

183
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:51,780
at every given point.

184
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,320
So these bottom two
points here correspond to

185
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,060
plus and minus x equals
the square root of two.

186
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,123
So if we go over here
and think about the case

187
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:01,882
where x equals the square root of two,

188
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,967
and we plug that in to the expression,

189
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:05,342
what are we gonna get?

190
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:08,043
Well, we're gonna get 12 multiplied by,

191
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:09,686
if x equals square root of two,

192
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:11,204
then x squared is equal to two,

193
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,889
so that's 12 times two, minus eight.

194
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:15,966
So that's 24 minus eight.

195
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:17,371
We're gonna get 16.

196
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,027
Which is a positive number,
which is why you have positive

197
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:22,331
concavity at each of these points.

198
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,489
So as far as the x direction
is concerned it feels like

199
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,557
oh yes, both of these
have positive concavity,

200
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:28,377
so they should look like local minima.

201
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:31,368
Then if you plug in zero,
if instead we went over here

202
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:35,996
and we said x equals zero,
then when you plug that in,

203
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:39,163
you'd have 12 times zero, minus eight.

204
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:43,485
And instead of 16, you would
be getting negative eight.

205
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,715
So because we have a negative
amount that gives you this

206
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:48,552
negative concavity on
the graph, which is why,

207
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:50,952
as far as x is concerned, the origin looks

208
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:53,420
like a local maximum.

209
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,523
So let's actually write that down.

210
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:57,606
If we kind of go down
here and we're analyzing

211
00:08:57,606 --> 00:09:00,038
each one of these, and we think
about what does it look like

212
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,533
from the perspective of each variable?

213
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,222
As far as x is concerned,

214
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:07,627
that origin should look like a max,

215
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:11,160
and then each of these two
points should look like minima.

216
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,009
This is kind of what
the variable x thinks.

217
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:17,741
And then the variable y,
if we do something similar,

218
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:21,604
and we take the second partial
derivative with respect to y,

219
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,569
I'll go ahead and write that over here

220
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:24,172
because this'll be pretty quick,

221
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:27,815
second partial derivative
with respect to y,

222
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:29,681
we're taking the derivative
of this expression,

223
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:32,499
with respect to y, and
that's just a constant.

224
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:33,724
That's just two.

225
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,366
And because it's positive,
it's telling you that

226
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,536
as far as y is concerned,

227
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:38,381
there's positive concavity every where.

228
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:40,936
And on the graph, what that would mean,

229
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:44,376
what that would mean, if you
just look at things where you

230
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,435
kind of slicing with a constant x value

231
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:48,528
to see pure movement in the y direction,

232
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:51,106
there's always going to
be positive concavity.

233
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,709
And here I've only drawn the plane

234
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,139
where x is constantly equal to zero,

235
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,094
but if you imagine kind of
sliding that plane around

236
00:09:57,094 --> 00:10:00,417
left and right, you're always
getting positive concavity.

237
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,616
So as far as y is concerned,

238
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:05,013
everything looks like a local minimum.

239
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:07,951
So we kind of go down here
and you'd say everything

240
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:09,312
looks like a local minimum.

241
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,812
Minimum, minimum, and minimum.

242
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:17,159
So it might be tempting here
to think that you're done,

243
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,315
to think you found all the
information you need to.

244
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:22,810
Because you say well in the x
and y direction, they disagree

245
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,507
about whether that origin should
be a maximum or a minimum,

246
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:27,610
which is why it looks like a saddle point,

247
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,736
and then they agree, they
agree on the other two points,

248
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:32,832
that both of them should
look like a minimum,

249
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,134
which is why, which is why you could say,

250
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,355
you think you might
say, both of these guys

251
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:38,980
look like a minimum.

252
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,556
However, that's actually not enough.

253
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,843
There are cases, there are
examples that I could draw

254
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,236
where doing this kind of
analysis would lead you

255
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:46,962
to the wrong conclusion.

256
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:49,195
You would conclude that
certain points are, you know,

257
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:52,005
a local minimum when in
fact they're a saddle point.

258
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,580
And the basic reason is that
you need to take into account

259
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,956
information given by that other
second partial derivative.

260
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,513
Because in the multi-variable world,

261
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:00,994
you can take the partial derivative

262
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,634
with respect to one variable,

263
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:04,667
and then with respect to another.

264
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,684
And you have to take into
account this mixed partial

265
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:09,723
derivative term in order
to make full conclusions.

266
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,082
And I'm a little bit
afraid that this video

267
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:13,703
might be running long,
so I'll cut it short here

268
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:16,783
and then I will give you the
second partial derivative test

269
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:19,344
in it's full glory, accounting for this

270
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,686
mixed partial derivative
term in the next video.

271
00:11:21,686 --> 00:11:24,489
I'll also, you know, give
intuition for where this comes in,

272
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:26,926
why this comes in, why
this simple analysis that

273
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:29,544
we did in this case is close
and it does give intuition

274
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:32,510
but it's not quite full
and it won't give you

275
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,109
the right conclusion always.

276
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:36,037
All right, I will see you then.
