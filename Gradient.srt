1
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:02,913
- [Voiceover] So here I'm
gonna talk about the gradient.

2
00:00:02,913 --> 00:00:05,040
And in this video, I'm only gonna describe

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,314
how you compute the gradient,

4
00:00:06,314 --> 00:00:07,614
and in the next couple ones

5
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:09,705
I'm gonna give the
geometric interpretation.

6
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:10,823
And I hate doing this,

7
00:00:10,823 --> 00:00:11,889
I hate showing the computation

8
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:14,097
before the geometric intuition

9
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,929
since usually it should
go the other way around,

10
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,637
but the gradient is one
of those weird things

11
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:19,732
where the way that you compute it

12
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:22,383
actually seems kind of
unrelated to the intuition

13
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:23,117
and you'll see that.

14
00:00:23,117 --> 00:00:25,028
We'll connect them in the next few videos.

15
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:26,209
But to do that, we need to know

16
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:28,167
what both of them actually are.

17
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:30,002
So on the computation side of things,

18
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:32,164
let's say you have some sort of function.

19
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:34,236
And I'm just gonna make it
a two-variable function.

20
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:39,110
And let's say it's f of x, y,
equals x-squared sine of y.

21
00:00:40,977 --> 00:00:42,857
The gradient is a way of packing together

22
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:45,908
all the partial derivative
information of a function.

23
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:48,070
So let's just start by computing
the partial derivatives

24
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:48,972
of this guy.

25
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:52,619
So partial of f with respect to x

26
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:54,830
is equal to,

27
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,071
so we look at this and we
consider x the variable

28
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,659
and y the constant.

29
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,424
Well in that case sine
of y is also a constant.

30
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:03,211
As far as x is concerned,

31
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:05,414
the derivative of x is 2x

32
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:06,793
so we see that this will

33
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:10,177
be 2x times that constant sine of y,

34
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,148
sine of y.

35
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:14,905
Whereas the partial derivative

36
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:16,492
with respect to y.

37
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:19,949
Now we look up here

38
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:22,380
and we say x is considered a constant

39
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,643
so x-squared is also considered a constant

40
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:26,959
so this is just a
constant times sine of y,

41
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,533
so that's gonna equal

42
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,464
that same constant times the cosine of y,

43
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:34,328
which is the derivative of sine.

44
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:37,069
So now what the gradient does

45
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,154
is it just puts both of these together

46
00:01:39,154 --> 00:01:40,132
in a vector.

47
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:44,445
And specifically, maybe
I'll change colors here,

48
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:48,127
you denote it with a little
upside-down triangle.

49
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:49,958
The name of that symbol is nabla,

50
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,871
but you often just pronounce it del,

51
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:54,273
you'd say del f or gradient of f.

52
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:57,215
And what this equals

53
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:59,120
is a vector

54
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,041
that has those two
partial derivatives in it.

55
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,422
So the first one is the partial derivative

56
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,651
with respect to x,

57
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:06,083
to x times sine of y.

58
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:11,045
And the bottom one, partial
derivative with respect to y

59
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:14,558
X-squared cosine of y.

60
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,432
And notice, maybe I should emphasize,

61
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,242
this is actually a vector-valued function.

62
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,050
So maybe I'll give it a
little bit more room here

63
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,047
and emphasize that it's got an x and a y.

64
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:33,907
This is a function that takes in

65
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:35,767
a point in two-dimensional space

66
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:38,371
and outputs a two-dimensional vector.

67
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:40,616
So you could also imagine doing this

68
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:42,552
with three different variables.

69
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:44,350
Then you would have three
partial derivatives,

70
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,076
and a three-dimensional output.

71
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:49,467
And the way you might
write this more generally

72
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:52,012
is we could go down here
and say the gradient

73
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:53,807
of any function

74
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:57,952
is equal to a vector with
its partial derivatives.

75
00:02:57,952 --> 00:03:01,126
Partial of f with respect to x,

76
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:05,604
and partial of f with respect to y.

77
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:09,060
And in some sense, we call
these partial derivatives.

78
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,311
I like to think as the
gradient as the full derivative

79
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:12,977
cuz it kind of captures
all of the information

80
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,324
that you need.

81
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:15,825
So a very helpful mnemonic device

82
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,388
with the gradient is to
think about this triangle,

83
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:21,158
this nabla symbol as being a vector

84
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:25,151
full of partial derivative operators.

85
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:28,465
And by operator, I just mean like partial

86
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:29,644
with respect to x,

87
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,267
something where you
could give it a function,

88
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,660
and it gives you another function.

89
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,649
So you give this guy the function f

90
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,516
and it gives you this expression,

91
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,790
this multi-variable function as a result.

92
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,595
So the nabla symbol is this vector full

93
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:44,229
of different partial derivative operators.

94
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:46,749
And in this case it might
just be two of them,

95
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:47,932
and this is kind of a weird thing

96
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,233
because it's like what,

97
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,140
this is a vector, it's
got like operators in it,

98
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,529
that's not what I thought vectors do.

99
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:54,844
But you can kind of see where it's going.

100
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:55,907
It's really just,

101
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:57,899
you can think of it as a memory trick,

102
00:03:57,899 --> 00:04:00,464
but in some sense it's a
little bit deeper than that.

103
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,609
And really when you take this triangle

104
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,325
and you say ok let's take this triangle

105
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:07,168
and you can kind of imagine
multiplying it by f,

106
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:09,280
really it's like an operator
taking in this function

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,476
and it's gonna give you another function.

108
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:13,105
It's like you take this
triangle and you put an f

109
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:15,221
in front of it, and you can imagine,

110
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,337
like this part gets
multipled, quote unquote

111
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:19,741
multiplied with f, this
part gets quote unquote

112
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,410
multiplied with f but
really you're just saying

113
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,168
you take the partial
derivative with respect to x

114
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:26,073
and then with y, and on and on.

115
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:27,178
And the reason for doing this,

116
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:29,536
this symbol comes up a
lot in other contexts.

117
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,775
There are two other operators
that you're gonna learn about

118
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:33,613
called the divergence and the curl.

119
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:34,507
We'll get to those later,

120
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,572
all in due time.

121
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:37,083
But it's useful to think about this

122
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,296
vector-ish thing of partial derivatives.

123
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:42,898
And I mean one weird thing about it,

124
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,869
you could say ok so this
nabla symbol is a vector

125
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,050
of partial derivative operators.

126
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,923
What's its dimension?

127
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:51,584
And it's like how many
dimensions do you got?

128
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,521
Because if you had a
three-dimensional function

129
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,032
that would mean that you should treat this

130
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:57,840
like it's got three different
operators as part of it.

131
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,708
And you know I'd kinda,
finish this off down here,

132
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,864
and if you had something
that was 100-dimensional

133
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:06,513
it would have 100
different operators in it

134
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:07,489
and that's fine.

135
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:08,426
It's really just again,

136
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:10,136
kind of a memory trick.

137
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:13,438
So with that, that's how
you compute the gradient.

138
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,241
Not too much too it,

139
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:15,673
it's pretty much just partial derivatives,

140
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:17,213
but you smack em into a vector

141
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,292
where it gets fun and
where it gets interesting

142
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:21,612
is with the geometric interpretation.

143
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,875
I'll get to that in
the next couple videos.

144
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,949
It's also a super important tool

145
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,232
for something called the
directional derivative.

146
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:29,483
So you've got a lot of fun stuff ahead.
