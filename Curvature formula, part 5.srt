1
00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:02,071
- [Voiceover] So, let's
sum up where we are so far.

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:04,221
We're looking at this formula

3
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:07,691
and trying to understand why
it corresponds to curvature.

4
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:10,000
Why it tells you how much
a curve actually curves.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,094
And the first thing we did is
we noticed that this numerator

6
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:16,176
corresponds to a certain cross-product.

7
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:17,838
The cross-product between
the first derivative

8
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:19,958
and the second derivative of the function

9
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,559
parameterizing the curve.

10
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,214
And the way we started to understand that

11
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:26,402
is we say, well, the function
parameterizing the curve

12
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:30,069
s of t produces vectors
whose tips trace out

13
00:00:30,993 --> 00:00:32,793
that curve itself.

14
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:35,950
And now if you think about
how one tip moves to the next

15
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,248
the direction that it needs to go

16
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:40,135
for that tip to move to the next one,

17
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:41,788
that's what the first
derivative tells you.

18
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:44,191
And when you treat that
in an infinitesimal way

19
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,282
this is why you get tangent
vectors along the curve

20
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:49,270
and there's an entire
series of videos on that

21
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,911
for the derivative of a
position vector valued function,

22
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:53,896
and they explain why the first derivative

23
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:55,640
of a parametric function,

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,023
gives you tangent vectors to that curve,

25
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:00,111
but if we draw all of
those tangent vectors

26
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:01,297
just in their own space,

27
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:03,503
their own little s prime of t space,

28
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:05,175
you get all of these vectors,

29
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:06,653
and we're rooting them at the same point

30
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:08,116
to be able to relate them more easily.

31
00:01:08,116 --> 00:01:10,500
The way that you move from
the tip of one of those

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,338
to the next one, is given
by the second derivative,

33
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:16,739
it kind of plays the same
roll for the first derivative

34
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,357
as the first derivative plays

35
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:20,153
for the original parametric function.

36
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:22,333
And specifically if
you have a circumstance

37
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,622
where the tangent
vectors are just turning,

38
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:27,459
the only thing they're doing
is purely turning around,

39
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,665
which is when your curve
is actually curving,

40
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:32,222
this corresponds to a case when the

41
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:35,455
second derivative function
is pretty much perpendicular

42
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:36,288
as vector.

43
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:37,968
The vector it produces is perpendicular

44
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,857
to the first derivative vector.

45
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:42,089
So, this is loosely why the cross-product

46
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:43,958
is kind of a good measurement of curving

47
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,884
cause it tells you how
perpendicular these guys are.

48
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:47,754
But, there is a bit of a catch.

49
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,872
The original formula for curvature,

50
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:52,847
the whole reason we're doing
it with respect to arc length

51
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,617
and not with respect to the parameter t,

52
00:01:54,617 --> 00:01:57,277
is that curvature
doesn't really care about

53
00:01:57,277 --> 00:01:58,844
how you parameterize the function.

54
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:00,705
If you imagine zipping
along it really quickly,

55
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:04,205
so your first derivative
vectors are all super long,

56
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:05,246
it shouldn't matter,

57
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:07,029
compared to crawling
along it like a turtle.

58
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:09,667
The curvature should
just always be the same.

59
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,239
But, this is a problem
if you think back to

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,278
the cross-product that
we're now looking at,

61
00:02:14,278 --> 00:02:15,687
where you're taking the
cross-product between

62
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:18,701
the first derivative and
the second derivative,

63
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:21,459
because if you were
traveling along this curve

64
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,873
twice as quickly, what that would mean is

65
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:25,425
your first derivative vector,

66
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:26,604
so I'll kind of draw it again over here,

67
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,372
would be twice as long,

68
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:30,500
to indicate that your going twice as fast.

69
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,331
And similarly your
second derivative vector,

70
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,240
to kind of keep up with
that changing rate,

71
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,788
would also be twice as long.

72
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:39,112
And as a result, the
parallelogram that they trace out,

73
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:42,851
I should actually, kinda
going off screen here.

74
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:46,606
The parallelogram that they trace out

75
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:48,610
would be actually four times as big.

76
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,443
Right?

77
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:51,822
Because both of the vectors get scaled up.

78
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:54,294
So, the way that we
really want to be thinking

79
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:57,602
about this is not the tangent
vector due to the derivative,

80
00:02:57,602 --> 00:02:59,002
but normalizing this.

81
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:00,130
And this should kind of make sense,

82
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,866
because we are thinking in
terms of unit tangent vectors

83
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,514
for the curvature as a whole.

84
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:06,464
So, if you imagine instead
kind of cutting of the vector

85
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:09,308
to make sure that it's got a unit length,

86
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:10,586
a length of one.

87
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:11,419
And what that means is,

88
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:12,568
you're taking the derivative vector

89
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,130
and dividing it by it's own magnitude,

90
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,450
by the magnitude of
that derivative vector,

91
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,986
and then similarly we'll want
to scale everything else down,

92
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:23,722
so you're taking this
and kinda scaling it down

93
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:25,139
by what you need.

94
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:28,686
The resulting parallelogram they trace out

95
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,841
is a more pure measurement of
how perpendicular they are,

96
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,478
without caring how long they are.

97
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:36,223
And with this guy would
be, by the way then,

98
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:37,838
this is the second derivative vector

99
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:40,291
not normalized with respect to itself,

100
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,566
but we're still dividing,

101
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:43,297
you know the thing we're diving by

102
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:44,419
as we scale everything down,

103
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,241
is still just the size of
that first derivative vector.

104
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:49,766
So, this cross-product, if
we take the cross-product

105
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:53,349
between s prime
normalized, s double prime,

106
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:58,227
oh no, no, no, sorry,

107
00:03:58,227 --> 00:03:59,367
s prime itself,

108
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,094
and I should be saying
vectors for all of these,

109
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:02,090
these are all vectors.

110
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,946
If we take the cross-product between that

111
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:06,171
and s double prime,

112
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:09,223
scaled down by that same
value that's still s prime,

113
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:12,813
so it's not normalized, this
is just scaled down by s prime.

114
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:16,837
This here is a more pure
measurement of how perpendicular

115
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:19,210
the second derivative vector is to first.

116
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,750
And the reason that we
don't really care about

117
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,577
the second derivative being normalized is,

118
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:23,485
if it was the case,

119
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:24,318
that you know,

120
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:25,779
the second derivative
was really, really strong

121
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,428
and wasn't necessarily a unit vector,

122
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:29,436
that's fine that's just telling us that

123
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,195
the tangent vector turns much more quickly

124
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:32,947
and the curvature should be higher.

125
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:36,730
And in fact, it turns out
that this whole expression is

126
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,864
the derivative of the
unit tangent vector t,

127
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,728
that unit tangent vector
that I've talked about a lot,

128
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:44,905
with respect to the parameter t.

129
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:48,421
So, whatever the parameter
of your original function is.

130
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,120
And now, if you think back to the,

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,953
I'm not sure if it was the last video

132
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:53,075
or the one before that,

133
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:54,047
but I talked about how,

134
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:55,329
when you take,

135
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,315
when we're looking for this derivative of

136
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:59,321
the tangent vector, with
respect to arc length,

137
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:01,800
the way that you compute this is to

138
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,130
first take its derivative
with respect to the parameter,

139
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,535
which is something we can actually do,

140
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:08,574
cause everything is expressed
in terms of that parameter,

141
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,907
and then dividing it by the,

142
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,205
basically, the change in arc length

143
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:14,637
with respect to that parameter,

144
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:17,277
which is the size of that
first derivative function.

145
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:19,045
So, if this whole thing is the derivative

146
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:21,517
of the tangent vector with respect to t,

147
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:23,221
what that means is when we take this,

148
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:26,054
and we divide that whole thing by,

149
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,753
the derivative, by s prime,

150
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:32,594
that should give us curvature,

151
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:34,913
and in fact that's just worth
writing in its own here.

152
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:36,466
That's curvature.

153
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,657
Curvature is equal to,

154
00:05:38,657 --> 00:05:40,525
and what I'm going to do
is, I'm going to take,

155
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,571
since we three different times,

156
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:44,412
we see the magnitude of s prime here,

157
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:45,680
magnitude of s prime here,

158
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,752
magnitude of s prime here.

159
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:48,905
Since we see that three times,

160
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,221
I'm going to go over here,

161
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,627
and I'm going to put
that on the denominator

162
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:53,293
but cubing it,

163
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:55,800
so s prime, that derivative vector,

164
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,591
the magnitude of that
derivative vector cubed.

165
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,552
And then on the top,
we still have s prime,

166
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:04,719
that vector s prime cross-product
with s double prime,

167
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,492
that vector.

168
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,216
And this, I mean, you could
think of this as yet another

169
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:11,055
formula for curvature,

170
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:12,741
I think I've given you
like four at this point.

171
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,711
Or, you could think of it as
just kind of the same thing,

172
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:19,077
and if we look back up
at our original one,

173
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,523
that I was trying to justify.

174
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:23,236
This is just the spelled
out version of it,

175
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:25,351
because what is this
bottom component here?

176
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,739
If we take x prime squared
plus y prime squared,

177
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:29,493
and if we think of the
square root of that,

178
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:31,196
so kinda taking it to the one half power,

179
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:34,195
that would be the magnitude
of the derivative,

180
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,812
and I kind of showed that in
some of the previous videos.

181
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:38,286
And what we're doing is we're cubing that,

182
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:41,142
so that whole formula
that's the very explicit,

183
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:42,946
you know, in terms of x and y's,

184
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:46,119
what's going on is really
just expressing this idea,

185
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,129
you take the cross-product
between the first derivative

186
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:49,149
and the second derivative,

187
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,135
and then because you're normalizing it,

188
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,204
you know normalizing with
respect to the first derivative,

189
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,676
you want to scale down
the second derivative

190
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:55,890
by that same amount,

191
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,717
just so the parallelogram we're thinking,

192
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,619
kinda shrinks and everything
stays in proportion.

193
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,005
And then once again we're
dividing about that s prime,

194
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,452
basically because
curvature is supposed to be

195
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:07,364
with respect to s, and
not with respect to t.

196
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:11,358
So, that's a way of, kinda
getting a correction factor

197
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:14,494
for how wrong you're going
to be if you just think

198
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:15,823
in terms of the parameter
t instead of steps

199
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:18,089
in terms of the arc length.

200
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,458
So, hopefully this makes
the original formula

201
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,816
a little bit less random, seeming,

202
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:24,175
you know, in this two dimensional case.

203
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:26,192
And it also gives another
strong conceptual tool

204
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,985
for understanding yet another
way that you can think about

205
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:32,783
how much a curve itself actually curves.

206
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:35,195
And I think I've probably
done enough videos here going

207
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:37,076
through all the different formulas,

208
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:38,724
for what curvatures should be.

209
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,725
And in the next one or
two I'll go through some

210
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,783
specific examples, just
to see what it looks like

211
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:45,200
to compute that.
