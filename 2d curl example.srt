00:00:00,832 --> 00:00:02,573
- [Voiceover] So let's compute
the two dimensional curl

2
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:03,793
of a vector field.

3
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:07,491
The one I have in mind will
have an x component of,

4
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:08,931
let's see not nine.

5
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:11,431
But y cubed minus nine times y

6
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:16,153
and then the y component will be x cubed

7
00:00:16,153 --> 00:00:18,253
minus nine times x.

8
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:20,193
You can kind see I'm just
a sucker for symmetry

9
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:21,690
when I choose examples.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,166
When I showed in the last video

11
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,872
how the two dimensional curl,

12
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:27,372
the 2D curl of a vector field,

13
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:33,115
of a vector field v which
is a function of x and y,

14
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:36,365
is equal to the partial derivative of q,

15
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:39,698
that second component, with respect to x

16
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:45,838
minus the partial derivative
of p that first component,

17
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,755
with respect to y.

18
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,520
And I went through the
reasoning for why this is true

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,760
but just real quick kinda
the in the nutshell here,

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,640
this partial q, partial x
is because of as you move

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,088
from left to right vectors
tend to go from having a small

22
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:01,420
or even negative y component
to a positive y component,

23
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,230
that corresponds to
counter clockwise rotation.

24
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,911
And similarly this dp,
dy is because if vectors

25
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:11,764
as you move up and down as you
kind of increase the y value

26
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:13,761
go from being positive to zero to negative

27
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:16,269
or if they're decreasing
that also corresponds

28
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:17,720
to counter clockwise rotation.

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,810
So taking the negative of that
will tell you whether or not

30
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,549
changes in the y direction
around your point

31
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,790
correspond with counter
clockwise rotation.

32
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,189
So in this particular case
when we start evaluating that,

33
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:30,103
we start by looking at partial
of q with respect to x.

34
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:32,159
So we're looking at the second
component and taking its

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,840
partial derivative with
respect to x and in this case,

36
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,080
nothing but x's show up so
it's just like taking its

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,247
derivative and you get
three x squared minus nine.

38
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,761
Three x squared minus nine,
and that's the first part.

39
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:51,929
Then we subtract off whatever
the partial derivative of p

40
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:54,589
with respect to y is, so we
go up here and it's entirely

41
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:57,155
in terms of y and trying to
do the symmetry we're just

42
00:01:57,155 --> 00:02:00,255
taking the same calculation,
three y squared that derivative

43
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:02,088
of y cubed minus nine.

44
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:08,285
So this right here is
our two dimensional curl.

45
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:10,444
And lets go ahead and
interpret what this means.

46
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:12,267
And in fact this vector
field that I showed you

47
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,869
is exactly the one that
I used when I was kind of

48
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:17,527
animating the intuition
behind curl to start off with,

49
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:19,512
where I had these specific
parts where there is

50
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:22,124
positive curl here and
here but negative curl

51
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:24,772
up in these clockwise rotating areas.

52
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:27,186
So we can actually see
why that's the case here

53
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:29,530
and why I chose this specific
function for something

54
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,750
that'll have lots of good curl examples.

55
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,551
Cause if we look over in that
region where there should be

56
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:37,966
positive curl, that's
where x is equal to three

57
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:40,067
and y is equal to zero.

58
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:44,422
So I go over here and say
if x is equal to three,

59
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:47,922
and y is equal to zero, this whole formula

60
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:51,388
becomes let's see, three
times three squared so,

61
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:55,079
three times three squared minus nine,

62
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,899
minus nine and then minus the
quantity now we're plugging

63
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:03,299
in y here so that's three
times y squared is just zero

64
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,863
cause y is equal to zero, minus nine.

65
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:09,790
Minus nine and so this part is 27,

66
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,468
that's three times nine is
27 minus nine gives us 18.

67
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:16,720
And then we're subtracting
off a negative nine

68
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,564
so that's actually plus nine
so this whole thing is 27,

69
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:22,943
it's actually quite positive,
so this is a positive number

70
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:25,289
and that's why when we go
over here and we're looking

71
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,318
at the fluid flow, you have
a counter clockwise rotation

72
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:29,568
in that region.

73
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,102
Whereas, let's say we did
all of this but instead of

74
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:36,655
x equals three and y
equals zero, we looked at

75
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:40,238
x is equal to zero and
y is equal to three.

76
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:43,609
So in that case,

77
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,102
we would instead, so x
equals zero, y equals three,

78
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,866
let's take a look at where that is.

79
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:53,221
X is zero, and then y the tick
mark's here are each one half

80
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:56,643
so y equals three is
right here, it's in that

81
00:03:56,643 --> 00:03:59,840
clockwise rotation area
so if I kind of play this,

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,859
we got the clockwise
rotation, we're expecting

83
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:03,010
a negative value.

84
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,744
Now let's see if that's what we get.

85
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,625
We go over here and I'm gonna evaluate

86
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,540
this whole function again.

87
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,930
How about plugging in
zero for x so this is

88
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,180
three times zero times zero minus nine.

89
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:20,080
And then we're subtracting off

90
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,620
three times y squared so that's
three times three squared.

91
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,703
Three squared minus nine.

92
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:30,286
And this whole part is zero
minus nine so that becomes

93
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:34,815
negative nine and over
here we're subtracting off

94
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:38,982
27 minus nine which is 18
so we're subtracting off 18,

95
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:44,229
so the whole thing equals negative 27.

96
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,608
So maybe I should say
that equals negative 27.

97
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:50,742
So because this is negative
that's what corresponds

98
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:54,051
to the clockwise rotation that we have

99
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:55,572
going on in that region.

100
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:57,186
And if you went and you plugged in a bunch

101
00:04:57,186 --> 00:04:59,044
of different points like
you could perhaps see

102
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:01,586
how if you plug in zero
for x and zero for y,

103
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:04,210
those nines cancel out
which is why over here

104
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,428
there's no general
rotation around the origin

105
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:08,343
when x and y are both equal to zero.

106
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:09,934
And you can understand
that every single point

107
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,314
and the general rotation
around every single point

108
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:16,427
just by taking this formula
that we found for 2D curl,

109
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:19,233
and plugging in the
corresponding values of x and y.

110
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:21,987
So it's actually a very powerful
tool cause you would think

111
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:24,184
that's a very complicated
thing to figure out right,

112
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:26,908
that if I give you this
pretty complicated fluid flow

113
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:29,787
and say hey I want you to
figure out a number that'll

114
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,445
tell me the general direction
and strength of rotation

115
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:35,220
around each point, that's a
lot of information so it's nice

116
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,311
just to have a small compact formula.
