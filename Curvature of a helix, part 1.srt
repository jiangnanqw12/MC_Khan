1
00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:01,843
- [Voiceover] So let's
compute the curvature of a

2
00:00:01,843 --> 00:00:04,527
three dimensional parametric curve

3
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:07,460
and the one I have in
mind has a special name.

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,744
It's a helix and the first two components

5
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,036
kind of make it look like a circle.

6
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:16,122
It's going to be cosine
of t for the x component,

7
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:18,019
sine of t for the y component

8
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,266
but this is three dimensional,
I know it makes it

9
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:21,790
a little different from a circle.

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,017
I'm going to have the last component

11
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:24,767
be t divided by five.

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,694
And what this looks like we
can visualize it pretty well.

13
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:31,306
I'm going to go on over
to the graph of it here.

14
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:34,610
So this shape is called a
helix and you can see how

15
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,176
looking from the x y planes perspective

16
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:38,973
it looks as if it's going to draw a circle

17
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:40,623
and really these lines should all line up

18
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,781
when you're facing it but
it's due to the perspective

19
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:44,766
where things farther away look smaller.

20
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:46,485
But it would just be drawing a circle,

21
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:49,382
but then the z component
because z increases

22
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,744
while your parameter t
increases, you're kind

23
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:54,650
of rising, as if it's a spiral staircase.

24
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,572
And now, before we compute curvature,

25
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:59,928
to know what we're really going
for, what this represents,

26
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:03,168
you kind of imagine yourself
, maybe this isn't a road,

27
00:01:03,168 --> 00:01:06,305
but it's like a space
freeway, and you're driving

28
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:09,045
your spaceship along it and
you imagine that you get stuck

29
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:12,016
at some point, or maybe
not that you get stuck,

30
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:13,405
but that all of your instruments lock.

31
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:14,915
And your steering wheel
locks or your joystick

32
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:17,014
or however you're steering,
it all just locks up

33
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:21,561
and you're gonna trace out
a certain circle in space.

34
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:24,505
And that circle might
look something like this.

35
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:26,435
So if you were turning
however you are on the helix,

36
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:28,090
but then you can't do anything different,

37
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,940
you might trace out a giant circle.

38
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,360
And what we care about is
the radius of that circle.

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,478
And if you take one divided
by the radius of that circle

40
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:40,298
you trace out that's
going to be the curvature.

41
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,166
That's going to be the
little kappa curvature.

42
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,817
And of course the way that we compute it,

43
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:45,495
we don't directly talk
about that circle at all,

44
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:46,530
but it's actually a good thing

45
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,278
to keep in the back of your mind.

46
00:01:48,278 --> 00:01:51,613
The way that we compute
it is to first find

47
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:55,168
the unit tangent vector
function with the same parameter

48
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:57,993
and what that means if you
imagine your helix spiraling

49
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,253
through three dimensional space.

50
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,746
Man, I am not as good an
artist as the computer is

51
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:05,517
when it comes to drawing a helix.

52
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:07,340
But the unit tangent vector function

53
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,059
would be something that gives you

54
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:11,959
a tangent vector at every given point,

55
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,417
you know kind of the direction that you

56
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,470
on your space ship are travelling.

57
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:19,441
And to do that you take the derivative of

58
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,245
your parameterization.

59
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:22,872
That derivative, which
is going to give you

60
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:25,322
a tangent vector, but it might
not be a unit tangent vector,

61
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:27,785
so you divide it by its own magnitude

62
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,727
And that'll give you
a unit tangent vector.

63
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:36,256
And then ultimately, the
goal that we're shooting for

64
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,052
is gonna be to find the derivative of this

65
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:41,984
tangent vector function with
respect to the arc length.

66
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:44,484
So as a first step, we'll start
by finding a derivative of

67
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:46,915
our paremetarization function.

68
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:48,944
So when we take that
derivative, luckily there's not

69
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:51,926
a lot of new things
going on for derivatives.

70
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:55,293
So S prime from single variable calculus,

71
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:57,138
we just take the derivative
of each component,

72
00:02:57,138 --> 00:03:01,241
so cosine goes to negative sine of t.

73
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:06,094
Sine, it's derivative is cosine of t

74
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:10,152
and then the derivative
of t divided by five

75
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:11,163
is just a constant.

76
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:12,583
That's just one over five.

77
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,456
Boy, it is hard to say the
word derivative over and over.

78
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,559
Say it five times.

79
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:21,019
So that's S prime of t,
and now what we need to do

80
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:24,542
we need to find the
magnitude of S prime of t.

81
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:28,192
So what that involves is
we're taking the magnitude

82
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,805
S prime of t as a vector.

83
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:33,282
We take the square root

84
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:35,633
of the sum of the squares
of each of its components.

85
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:39,265
So, sine, negative sine squared

86
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:41,517
just looks like sine squared.

87
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:42,900
Sine squared of t.

88
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:44,791
Cosine squared.

89
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:50,102
Cosine squared of t.

90
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:51,755
And then one fifth squared

91
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:54,412
and that's just one twenty fifth.

92
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:59,897
You might notice I use a lot
of these sine cosine pairs

93
00:03:59,897 --> 00:04:01,783
in examples, partly
because they draw circles

94
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,943
and lots of things are fun
that involve drawing circles.

95
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,994
But also because it has a
tendency to let things simplify

96
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:08,553
especially if you are taking a magnitude

97
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,153
because sine squared plus cosine squared

98
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:12,270
just equals one.

99
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,067
So this entire formula boils down

100
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:21,434
to the square root of one
plus one divided by 25.

101
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,467
And for this you might be
thinking off to the side that

102
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:30,467
that's 25 over 25 plus one over 25

103
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:34,981
So making even more room
here, what that equals

104
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:40,274
is the square root of 26 divided by 25.

105
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,742
And just because 25 is
already a square and it might

106
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:47,983
make things look nice I am
going to write this as the

107
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:51,500
square root of 26 divided by 5,

108
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,164
the square root of 25.

109
00:04:53,164 --> 00:04:57,601
This whole thing is the
magnitude of our derivative.

110
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,919
And we think to ourselves,
it's quite lucky

111
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,475
that this came out to be a constant

112
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,982
because, as we saw with
the more general formula,

113
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:07,352
it's often pretty nasty
and it can get pretty bad.

114
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:09,313
But in this case, it's just a constant,

115
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:12,090
which is nice because
as we go up and we start

116
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,547
to think about what our
unit tangent vector function

117
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:18,898
for the helix should be, we're just going

118
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:20,553
to take the derivative function

119
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,744
and divide each term by that magnitude.

120
00:05:23,744 --> 00:05:25,529
So it's going to look almost identical.

121
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:28,406
It's going to be negative sine of t.

122
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:31,173
Except now we're dividing
by that magnitude

123
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,294
and that magnitude of course

124
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:34,024
is root 26 over five,

125
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:38,131
So we go up here and we
say we're dividing this

126
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:42,938
by root 26 over five.

127
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:44,304
That whole quantity.

128
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:49,942
And then similarly y
component is cosine of t

129
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:53,609
divided by the quantity of the root

130
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:56,163
26 divided by 5.

131
00:05:57,443 --> 00:06:02,120
The last part is one fifth,
I'll put that in parenthesis,

132
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,177
divided by that same amount.

133
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:06,674
root 26 over five.

134
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:08,243
So we're just taking the whole vector

135
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,243
and we're dividing it by the magnitude

136
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:12,345
that it has and we're lucky, again,

137
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:14,401
that even though this vector
is a function, and it can

138
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:16,627
depend on t, the magnitude doesn't.

139
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,079
So the unit tangent vector function we get

140
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,821
as a result is relatively simple.

141
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:24,829
And I'll call it a day
here and then continue on

142
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:27,003
on with the same line of
reasoning in the next video.
