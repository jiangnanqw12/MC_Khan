00:00:00,505 --> 00:00:01,442
- [Voiceover] In the last video

2
00:00:01,442 --> 00:00:02,620
we took a look at this function

3
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,855
f of x, y equal x to the fourth

4
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:06,889
minus four x squared plus y squared

5
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:09,653
which has the graph that
you're looking at on the left.

6
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:11,404
And we looked for all of the points

7
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:13,636
where the gradient is equal to zero.

8
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:15,468
Which basically means
both partial derivatives

9
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:17,581
are equal to zero and we solved that

10
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:20,566
and we found that there
were three different points.

11
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:22,953
The origin zero, zero,
and then square root

12
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:25,321
of two, zero and negative
square root of two, zero

13
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:27,029
which corresponds to this origin here

14
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,566
which is a saddle point and
then these two local minima.

15
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,190
And it seemed like we had
a reasonable explanation

16
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,572
for why this is a saddle point

17
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:35,240
and why both of those are local minima.

18
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,025
'Cause we took the
second partial derivative

19
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:38,815
with respect to x, that
was kind of all over

20
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:40,728
the board here, second partial derivative

21
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:42,678
with respect to x, and found that when you

22
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:45,649
evaluate it at x equals zero
you get a negative number,

23
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:47,555
kind of indicating a negative concavity

24
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:49,223
so it should look like a maximum.

25
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:50,970
And then when you do the same with

26
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,671
the second partial derivative of y,

27
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:56,290
man I always do this, I
always leave out the squared

28
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,873
on that lower term there, okay,

29
00:00:57,873 --> 00:01:01,182
so second partial
derivative with respect to y

30
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:03,826
you get two as a constant, a positive.

31
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:05,413
And that kind of indicates that it looks

32
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:06,839
like a minimum to y.

33
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:09,275
So that's why, you know, this origin point

34
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:10,699
looks like a saddle point
'cause the x direction

35
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:13,219
and y direction disagree
and when you do this

36
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,093
with the other points
they kind of both agree

37
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:16,635
that it should look like a minimum.

38
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:18,222
But I said that's not enough, I said

39
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:19,405
that you need to take into account

40
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:20,913
the mixed partial derivative term.

41
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:23,758
And to see why that's true let me go ahead

42
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:26,154
and pull up another example for you here.

43
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:28,794
So the graph of the function
that you're looking at

44
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:30,827
right now, it clearly has a saddle point

45
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:32,895
at the origin that we can see visually,

46
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:37,571
but when we get the
equation for this function,

47
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:41,738
the equation is f of x,
y is equal to x squared

48
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,834
plus y squared minus four times xy.

49
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:50,881
Now let's go ahead and analyze

50
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,345
the partial differential information

51
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,767
of this function, we'll just take

52
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,676
it's partial derivatives, so the partial

53
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:58,685
with respect to x is equal to,

54
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,578
so we've got, when we
differentiate this term

55
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:04,709
we get two x, two x, y
looks like a constant,

56
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,537
we do nothing, and then this last term

57
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:08,584
looks like negative four times y

58
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:12,932
'cause y looks like a
constant, so negative four y.

59
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,215
And when we do the partial derivative

60
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:18,026
with respect to y, very
similarly we're gonna get two and

61
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:20,181
when we differentiate y squared.

62
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,398
Two y, and now we subtract minus four x

63
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:24,824
'cause x looks like the constant and y

64
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:28,735
looks like the variable, minus four x.

65
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:31,335
Now when we plug in x and
y are each equal to zero,

66
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:33,212
you know, we plug in the origin point

67
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:35,365
to both of these functions, we see

68
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:36,589
that they're equal to zero.

69
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,651
'Cause x is zero, y is
zero, this guy goes to zero.

70
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,644
Similarly over here, that goes to zero.

71
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:45,891
So we will indeed get a flat
tangent plane at the origin.

72
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:48,376
But now let's take a look at
the second partial derivatives.

73
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,821
If we do the second
partial derivatives purely

74
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:53,018
in terms of x and y, so if we take

75
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:56,937
the pure second partial derivative of f

76
00:02:56,937 --> 00:03:00,477
with respect to x squared what we get,

77
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:02,753
we look at this expression,
we differentiate

78
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:06,214
it with respect to x and we
get a constant positive two

79
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:08,169
because that y does nothing for us.

80
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,208
And then similarly, when
we take the second partial

81
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,941
derivative with respect to y,
always forget that squared on

82
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,644
the bottom, we also get
a constant positive two

83
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:18,639
because this x does nothing for us

84
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,083
when we take the derivative
with respect to y.

85
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,871
So we get constant positive two.

86
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,185
So this would suggest that, you know,

87
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:26,979
there's positive concavity
in the x direction,

88
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,052
there's positive concavity
in the y direction,

89
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,432
so it would suggest that, you know,

90
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,936
it looks like an upward smiley face

91
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:34,499
from all directions and it
should be a local minimum.

92
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:36,168
But when we look at the
graph this isn't true,

93
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:38,977
it's not a local minimum,
it's a saddle point.

94
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:40,770
So what this tells us is that these two

95
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,844
second partial derivatives aren't enough,

96
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:44,186
we need more information.

97
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:45,525
And what it kinda comes down to is that

98
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,968
this last term here, minus four xy,

99
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:49,600
oh, actually, I think I made a mistake,

100
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,221
I think I meant to make this plus four xy.

101
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:56,801
So let's see, plus four xy
which would influence these.

102
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,632
It actually won't make a difference,

103
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:00,258
it still gives a saddle point,

104
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:02,455
but anyway, we've got
this plus four xy term

105
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:04,002
that evidently makes a difference.

106
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,503
That evidently kind of, influences

107
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:07,652
whether this is a local
minimum or a maximum.

108
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:10,210
And just to give a loose intuition
for what's going on here.

109
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,709
If instead of writing four here, I wrote,

110
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,227
I'm gonna write the variable P, okay,

111
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:17,406
and P is just gonna be some number

112
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:20,208
and I'm gonna move that variable around.

113
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,909
I'm gonna basically let it
range from zero up to four.

114
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:26,349
So right now, as you're looking
at it it's sitting at four.

115
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,100
So I'm gonna pull it
back and kind of let it

116
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,803
range back to zero just to see

117
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,017
how this influences the graph.

118
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:35,094
And we see that once we
pull it back to zero,

119
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:36,727
we get something where it kinda reflects

120
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,721
what you would expect,
where from the x direction

121
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:40,430
it's a positive smiley
face, from the y direction

122
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,162
it's also a positive smiley
face and everything's good,

123
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:45,199
it looks like the local minimum and it is.

124
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,797
And even as you let P range more and more,

125
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:50,353
and here P is around,
I'm guessing right now

126
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:52,430
it's around 1.5, you get something

127
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,014
that's still a local minimum.

128
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:56,658
It's a positive concavity
in all directions,

129
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:58,322
but there's a critical point here

130
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:00,274
where as you're moving P, at some point

131
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:03,479
it kind of passes over and
turns it into a saddle point.

132
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,630
And again, this is
entirely the coefficient

133
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,699
in front of the xy term,
it has nothing to do

134
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,949
with the x squared or the y squared.

135
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,969
So at some point it kinda passes over

136
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:15,756
and from that point on everything

137
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,785
is going to be a saddle point.

138
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,043
And in a moment it'll become clear

139
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:20,792
that that critical point happens

140
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:22,339
when P is equal to two.

141
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,700
So right here it's gonna
be when P equals two,

142
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,863
it kinda passes from making
things a local minimum

143
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:29,694
to a saddle point.

144
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,688
And let me show you the
test which will tell us

145
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:32,869
why this is true.

146
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:35,839
So the full reasoning behind this test

147
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,754
is something that I'll
get to in later videos,

148
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,477
but right now I just want to,
kind of have it on the table

149
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:42,955
and teach you what it
is and how to use it.

150
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:46,699
So this is called the second
partial derivative test.

151
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,848
Second partial derivative
test, I'll just write

152
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:53,765
deriv test since I'm a slow writer.

153
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,345
And basically what it says is if you found

154
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:58,421
a point where the
gradient of your function

155
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:00,253
at this point, and I'll write it kind of

156
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:03,711
x not, y not is our point, if
you found where it equals zero

157
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:06,803
then calculate the following value.

158
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:08,268
You'll take the second partial derivative

159
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,262
with respect to x twice,
so here I'm just using

160
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:12,701
that subscript notation
which is completely

161
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:14,934
the same as saying, you know,
second partial derivative

162
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:16,887
with respect to x twice, just different

163
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:18,681
choice in notation, and you evaluate it

164
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:22,848
at this point, x not, y
not, then you multiply that

165
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:26,249
by the second partial
derivative with respect to y

166
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:30,075
evaluated at that same point, y not,

167
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:33,046
and then you subtract off
the mixed partial derivative,

168
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:34,873
the one where first you
do it with respect to x

169
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:36,743
then with respect to y,
or in the other order,

170
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,373
it doesn't really matter as long as you

171
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:40,365
take it with respect
to both the variables.

172
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,924
You subtract off that guy squared.

173
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,567
So what you do is you
compute this entire value

174
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,317
and it's gonna give you
some kind of number,

175
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:49,512
and let's give it a name, let's name it H,

176
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:54,270
and if it's the case that
H is greater than zero

177
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,682
then you have either a max or a min,

178
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,143
you're not sure which one yet

179
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:01,095
and it's a max or a min.

180
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:02,474
And you can tell whether it's a maximum

181
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:04,304
or a minimum basically by
looking at one of these

182
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,662
partial derivative with respect to x twice

183
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:08,979
or with respect to y twice and kind of

184
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:11,014
getting a feel for the
concavity there, right.

185
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,720
If this was positive it would indicate

186
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,592
kind of a smiley face concavity

187
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:16,300
and it would be a local minimum.

188
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,966
And the fact that this entire value H

189
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:20,040
is greater than zero is what you need

190
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,466
to tell you that you can just do that,

191
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,700
you can look at the concavity with respect

192
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,690
to one of those guys and that'll tell you

193
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,579
the information you need
about the entire graph.

194
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:32,153
But if H is less than zero,
if H is less than zero,

195
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:36,054
then you definitely have a saddle point.

196
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:37,137
Saddle point.

197
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:44,066
And if H is purely equal to zero,

198
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,386
if you get that unlucky
case, then you don't know,

199
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:47,848
then the second partial derivative test

200
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:49,436
isn't enough to determine.

201
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,062
But almost all cases
you'll find that either

202
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:54,186
it's purely greater than zero
or purely less than zero.

203
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:56,345
So as an example let's
see what that looks like

204
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:59,107
in the case of the specific
function we started with.

205
00:07:59,107 --> 00:08:00,613
Where P is some constant
that I was letting

206
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,200
kind of, range from zero to four

207
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,433
when I was animating it
here, but you should just

208
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,709
think of P as being some number.

209
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,990
Well in that case, this value H

210
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,426
that we plug in, and let's
say we're plugging it in

211
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:13,869
at the origin, right, we're
analyzing at the origin.

212
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,063
Well we've already calculated
the partial derivative

213
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:19,399
with respect to x twice in
a row and y twice in a row

214
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,633
and both of those, when we computed those

215
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,034
were just constants two, they
were equal to two everywhere

216
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:27,205
and in particular they're
equal to two at the origin.

217
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,154
So we can go ahead and just plug in those

218
00:08:29,154 --> 00:08:32,649
and we see that this is two times two

219
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,723
and then now we need to subtract off

220
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,444
the mixed partial derivative squared.

221
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:39,359
So if we go ahead and compute that

222
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,631
where we take the derivative
with respect to x and then and

223
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:44,028
or y and then x, let's
say we started with the

224
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:46,752
partial derivative with respect to x.

225
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:49,953
When we take this
derivative with respect to y

226
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:51,623
we're gonna get this constant term

227
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,045
that's sitting in front of the y.

228
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:56,297
But really it's whatever this
constant P happened to equal.

229
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:57,889
And you might be able
to see that just looking

230
00:08:57,889 --> 00:08:59,191
at this function, that when you take

231
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:00,898
the mixed partial derivative it's gonna be

232
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:02,810
the coefficient in front of the xy term,

233
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,840
'cause it's kind of like, first you do

234
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,785
the derivative with respect
to x and the x goes away

235
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:09,385
and then with respect to
y and that y goes away

236
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:11,864
and you're just left with a constant.

237
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:12,880
So what you end up getting here

238
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,795
in the second partial derivative test,

239
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:17,110
when we take that value which is P,

240
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,302
which might equal four or zero or whatever

241
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:22,420
we happen to have it
as and we square that,

242
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,871
we square that, that's gonna be the value

243
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,253
that we analyze.

244
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:29,343
So in the case where P
was equal to zero, right,

245
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,454
if we go over here and we scale so that P

246
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:34,304
is completely equal to zero,
then our entire value H,

247
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:38,696
H would equal four, and
because H is positive

248
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,773
it's definitely a maximum or a minimum

249
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:42,440
and then by analyzing one of those

250
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,407
second partial derivatives
with respect to x or y

251
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:47,481
and seeing that it's positive concavity,

252
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:50,042
we would see, oh, it's
definitely a local minimum

253
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:52,603
'cause positive concavity
gives local minimum.

254
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:54,068
But in the other case where, let's say

255
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:58,170
we let P range such that P
is all the way equal to four,

256
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,655
in formulas what that means for us

257
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:03,748
when we let P equal four is we're taking

258
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:06,151
two times two, minus four squared.

259
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:08,843
We're taking two times two, minus 16.

260
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:11,198
What that would imply,
sorry about getting kinda

261
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:15,022
scrunched on the board
here, is that H is equal to,

262
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:18,524
let's see four minus 16, negative 12.

263
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:22,228
I'm just gonna erase this to
kind of, clear up some room.

264
00:10:22,228 --> 00:10:25,030
So when P equals four,
this is negative 12.

265
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,038
And in fact, this kind of
explains the crossover point

266
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:30,237
for when it goes from being local minimum

267
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,066
to a saddle point.

268
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,463
It's gonna be at that point where

269
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:36,864
this entire expression is equal to zero.

270
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:39,873
And you can see that
happens when P equals two.

271
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,783
So over here the crossover point

272
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:42,963
when it kind of goes from being

273
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:46,059
a local minimum to a saddle
point is at P equals two.

274
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:48,861
And when P perfectly
equals two, let's see,

275
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:52,848
so about here, the second
partial derivative test

276
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:54,967
isn't gonna be enough to tell us anything.

277
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,714
It can't tell us it's definitely a max

278
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:59,723
and it can't tell us that
it's definitely a saddle point

279
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:01,753
and in this particular
case that that corresponds

280
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:04,275
to the fact that the
graph is perfectly flat

281
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,998
in one direction and a
minimum in another direction.

282
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:08,510
In other cases it might
mean something different

283
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,813
and I'll probably make a video

284
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,769
just about that special case when

285
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:14,049
this whole value is equal to zero.

286
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,515
But for now all that I want to emphasize

287
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:18,647
is what this test is
where you take all three

288
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:20,561
second partial derivatives and you kind of

289
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:21,870
multiply together the two pure

290
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,863
second partial derivatives where you do

291
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,628
x and then x, and then one
where you do y and then y,

292
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:28,211
you multiply those together and then

293
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:32,155
you subtract off that mixed
partial derivative squared.

294
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:33,581
And in the next video I'll try to give

295
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:35,128
a little bit more intuition for,

296
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,792
you know, where this
whole formula comes from,

297
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,053
why it's not completely random,

298
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:39,800
why taking this and analyzing

299
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,262
whether it's greater than zero

300
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:44,273
or less than zero is a
reasonable thing to do

301
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:46,875
for analyzing whether a
point that you're looking at

302
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:50,338
is a local minimum or a local
maximum or a saddle point.

303
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:51,421
See you then.
