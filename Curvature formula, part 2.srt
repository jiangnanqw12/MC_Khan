1
00:00:00,374 --> 00:00:02,013
- [Voiceover] In the last
video I started to talk about

2
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:03,773
the formula for curvature.

3
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:06,464
Just to remind everyone of where we are

4
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:09,571
you imagine that you have some
kind of curve in let's say

5
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:12,394
two dimensional space just
for the sake of being simple.

6
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:17,265
Let's say this curve is
parameterized by a function S of T.

7
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:20,048
So every number T corresponds
to some point on the curve.

8
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:22,013
For the curvature you start thinking about

9
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:23,812
unit tangent vectors.

10
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:25,652
At every given point what does the unit

11
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:27,082
tangent vector look like?

12
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:30,768
The curvature itself which
is denoted by this sort of

13
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:32,571
Greek letter Kappa

14
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:35,477
is gonna be the rate of
change of those unit vectors

15
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:38,264
kind of how quick they're
turning in direction

16
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:40,352
not with respect to the parameter t

17
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:43,216
but with respect to arc length d s.

18
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:45,998
What I mean by arc length here is

19
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:48,292
just a tiny step you can think

20
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:52,185
the size of a tiny step
along the curve would be d s.

21
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,969
You're wondering, as you
take a tiny step like that

22
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:57,015
does the unit tangent
vector turn a a lot or

23
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,405
does it turn a little bit?

24
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:00,616
The little schematic that I
said you might have in mind

25
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:02,705
is just a completely separate space

26
00:01:02,705 --> 00:01:05,612
where for each one of
these unit tangent vectors

27
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:08,314
you go ahead and put them in that space

28
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:12,202
saying okay so this one would
look something like this

29
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:14,374
this one is pointed down
and to the right so it would

30
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,837
look something like this.

31
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:18,386
This one is pointed very much down.

32
00:01:18,386 --> 00:01:20,448
You're wondering basically
as you take tiny little steps

33
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,448
of size d s what is this

34
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:26,307
change to the unit tangent vector

35
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:30,028
and that change is gonna
be some kind of vector.

36
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:32,323
Because the curvature's
really just a value

37
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:34,699
a number that we want all
we care about is the size

38
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:36,296
of that vector.

39
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,963
The size of the change
to the tangent vector

40
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:44,063
as you take a tiny step in d s.

41
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,495
Now this is pretty abstract right?

42
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:47,786
I've got these two completely
separate things that

43
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:51,095
are not the original functions
that you have to think about.

44
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:54,225
You have to think about this
unit tangent vector function

45
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,704
and then you also have to think about this

46
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:57,343
notion of arc length.

47
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:59,389
The reason, by the way,
that I'm using an s here

48
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:03,398
as well as here for the
parameterized of the curve

49
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:05,320
is because they're actually quite related.

50
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,160
I'll get to that a little bit below.

51
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,262
To make it clear what this
means I'm gonna go ahead

52
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,658
and go through an example
here where let's say our

53
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:14,491
parameterized with respect to t is

54
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:18,557
a cosine sine pair.

55
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:21,347
So we've got cosine of
t as the x component

56
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:24,051
and then sine of t as the y component

57
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:24,897
sine of t.

58
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:27,312
Just to make it so that
it's not completely boring

59
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:32,221
let's multiply both of these
components by constant r.

60
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:33,983
What this means, you might recognize this,

61
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,341
cosine sine pair

62
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:36,591
what this means

63
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:40,685
is that in the x y plane

64
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:43,343
you're actually drawing
a circle with radius r.

65
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:47,928
This would be some kind of
circle with the radius r.

66
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:50,710
While I go through this example
I also want to make a note

67
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,984
of what things would look like
a little bit more abstractly.

68
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:58,200
If we just had s of t equals
not specific functions

69
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,532
that I laid down but
just any general function

70
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:03,356
for the x component and
for the y component.

71
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:06,222
The reason I want to do
this is because the concrete

72
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:09,129
version is gonna be helpful
and simple and something

73
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,239
we can deal with but
almost so simple as to

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,901
not be indicative of just
how complicated the normal

75
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,890
circumstances but the
more general circumstances

76
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,731
so complicated I think
it will actually confuse

77
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:21,084
things a little bit too much.

78
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:22,475
It'll be good to kind of go through

79
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:24,558
both of them in parallel.

80
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:27,140
The first step is to
figure out what is this

81
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,737
unit tangent vector?

82
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:31,060
What is that function
that at every given point

83
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,061
gives you a unit tangent
vector to the curve?

84
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:36,128
The first thing for that

85
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,600
is to realize that

86
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,604
we already have a notion
of what should give the

87
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:40,791
tangent vector

88
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,494
the derivative of our
vector valued function

89
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:45,336
as a function of t

90
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,792
the direction in which in points is

91
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,470
in the tangent direction.

92
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,620
If I go over here and if
I compute this derivative

93
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,453
and I say s prime of t

94
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:56,547
which involves just taking the

95
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:57,939
derivative of both components so the

96
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:01,022
derivative of cosine is negative sine

97
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:06,123
of t multiplied by r and the derivative

98
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:07,540
of sine is cosine

99
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:10,559
of t multiplied by r.

100
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,633
More abstractly, this is just gonna be

101
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:20,143
anytime you have two
different component functions

102
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:22,448
you just take the derivative of each one.

103
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:24,209
Hopefully you've seen this, if not

104
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:26,094
maybe take a look of videos on

105
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:30,338
taking the derivative of a
position vector valued function.

106
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:32,678
This we can interpret
as that tangent vector

107
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:34,930
but it might not be a unit vector right?

108
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,522
We want a unit tangent vector and this

109
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:38,770
only promises us the direction.

110
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,937
What we do to normalize it

111
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:46,881
and get a unit tangent vector function

112
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,590
which I'll call capital t of lowercase t

113
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,819
that's kind of confusing right?

114
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:57,375
Capital t is for tangent vector

115
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,426
lowercase t is the parameter.

116
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,667
I'll try to keep that straight.

117
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,932
It's sort of standard notation but

118
00:05:04,932 --> 00:05:07,761
there is the potential
to confuse with this.

119
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:11,928
What that's gonna be is
your vector value derivative

120
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:16,969
but normalized. So we have to divide by

121
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:19,095
whatever it's magnitude is

122
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:21,261
as a function of t.

123
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:23,594
In this case, in a specific example

124
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:27,177
that magnitude, if we
take the magnitude of

125
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:30,410
negative sine of t r

126
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,330
multiply by r

127
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,997
and then cosine of t

128
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,711
multiplied by r

129
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,628
so we're taking the magnitude
of this whole vector

130
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:43,545
what we get

131
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,564
make myself even more room here

132
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,064
is the square root

133
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,916
of sine squared

134
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,824
negative sine squared is
just gonna be sine squared

135
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:58,552
so sine squared of t
multiplied by r squared

136
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:02,444
and then over here cosine
square times r squared

137
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:05,361
cosine squared of t times r squared

138
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,447
we can bring that r squared
outside of the radical

139
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,045
to sort of factor it out

140
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:13,539
turning it into an r

141
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,672
and on the inside we have sine
squared plus cosine squared

142
00:06:17,672 --> 00:06:19,803
I'm being too lazy to write
down the t's right now

143
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:21,891
because no matter what
the t is that whole value

144
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:23,224
just equals one.

145
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:27,283
This entire thing is just gonna equal r.

146
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:30,927
What that means is that our
unit tangent vector up here

147
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:34,652
is gonna be the original
function but divided by r.

148
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,087
It happens to be a
constant usually it's not

149
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:38,483
but it happens to be a
constant in this case.

150
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,860
What that looks like

151
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,254
given that our original function is

152
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:45,203
negative sine of t times
r and cosine of t times r

153
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:47,170
we're dividing out by an r

154
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,505
the ultimate function that we get

155
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:51,672
is just negative sine of t

156
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:55,262
and then cosine of t.

157
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,307
For fear of running a little bit long

158
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:02,230
I think I'll call it an
end to this video and

159
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,803
continue on with the same
argument in the next video.
