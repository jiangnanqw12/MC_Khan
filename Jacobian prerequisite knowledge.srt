00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,988
- Hello, everyone. In
these next few videos,

2
00:00:01,988 --> 00:00:03,571
I'm going to be talking
about something called,

3
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:04,998
the Jacobian,

4
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:08,070
and more specifically,
it's the Jacobian matrix,

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,628
or sometimes the associated determinant,

6
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:11,843
and here, I just want to talk

7
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:14,123
about some of the background
knowledge that I'm assuming,

8
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:15,864
because to understand the Jacobian,

9
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:16,851
you do have to have a little bit

10
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,524
of a background in linear
algebra, and in particular,

11
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:22,136
I want to make sure that
everyone here understands

12
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:26,814
how to think about matrices
as transformations of space,

13
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:27,973
When I say transformations,

14
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:29,519
here, let me just get
kind of a matrix on here.

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,186
I'll call it two one
and negative three one.

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,359
You'll see why I'm coloring
it like this in just a moment.

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,854
When I say, how to think about this

18
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:40,716
as a transformation of space,

19
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,589
I mean, you can multiply a matrix

20
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,116
by some kind of two-dimensional vector,

21
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:47,349
some kind of two-dimensional x y,

22
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:50,228
and this is going to give us
a new two-dimensional vector.

23
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:52,812
This is going to bring us
to, let's see in this case,

24
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:53,645
it'll be,

25
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:59,936
I'll write kind of two
one negative three one,

26
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,328
where what it gives us

27
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:04,661
is two x plus negative three times y,

28
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:09,444
and then, one x plus one times y.

29
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:14,879
Right? This is a new
two-dimensional vector

30
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,445
somewhere else in space,

31
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,299
and even if you know how to compute it,

32
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:21,763
there's still room for a
deeper geometric understanding

33
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:24,763
of what it actually means
to take a vector x y

34
00:01:24,763 --> 00:01:27,808
to the vector two x plus negative three y

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,238
and one x plus one y.

36
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:31,862
There's also still a deeper understanding

37
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:36,422
in what we mean when we call
this a linear transformation,

38
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:38,422
a linear transformation.

39
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,643
What I'm going to do is just show you

40
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,872
what this particular
transformation looks like

41
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:46,298
on the left here, where every single point

42
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:48,832
on this blue grid, I'm
going to tell the computer,

43
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:51,969
"Hey, if that point was x
y, I want you to take it

44
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:55,676
to two x plus negative
three y, one x plus one y.

45
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:57,917
Here's what it looks like.

46
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,148
Let me just kind of play it out here.

47
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:02,059
All of the points in space move,

48
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:04,443
and you end up in some final state here.

49
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:06,475
There are a couple
important things to note.

50
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:08,467
First of all, all of the grid lines

51
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,747
remain parallel and evenly spaced,

52
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:11,843
and they're still lines.

53
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,627
They didn't get curved in some way,

54
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,059
and that's very, very special.

55
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:17,084
That is the geometric
way that you can think

56
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:20,499
about this term, this idea
of a linear transformation.

57
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:23,484
I kind of like to think about
it that lines stay lines,

58
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:25,699
and in particular the grid lines here,

59
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:27,067
the ones that started off

60
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:29,870
as kind of vertical and horizontal,

61
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,822
they still remain parallel,

62
00:02:31,822 --> 00:02:34,650
and they still remain evenly spaced.

63
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,841
The other thing to notice here is

64
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,962
I have these two vectors highlighted:

65
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,994
the green vector and the red vector.

66
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,002
These are the ones that started off,

67
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:43,425
if we kind of back things up,

68
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:45,105
these are the ones that started off

69
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:47,438
as the basis vectors, right?

70
00:02:48,346 --> 00:02:50,274
Let me kind of make a
little bit more room here.

71
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:52,691
The green vector is one zero,

72
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,742
one in the x-direction,
zero in the y-direction,

73
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:59,286
and then that red vertical vector here,

74
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:00,286
is zero one,

75
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:03,116
zero one.

76
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:08,565
If we notice where they land,

77
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,437
under this transformation,

78
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:11,511
when the matrix is multiplied

79
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:14,666
by every single vector in space,

80
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,704
the place where the green vector lands,

81
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:18,672
the one that started off as one zero,

82
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:20,672
has coordinates two one,

83
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,536
and that corresponds very
directly with the fact

84
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,993
that the first column of
our matrix is two one.

85
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:29,481
Then, similarly, over
here, the second vector,

86
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:31,369
the one that started off as zero one,

87
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:34,225
ends up at the coordinates
negative three one,

88
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:36,106
and that's what corresponds with the fact

89
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:40,032
that the next column
is negative three one.

90
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:41,831
It's actually relatively simple to see

91
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:43,759
why that's going to be true.

92
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,201
Here, I'll go ahead and
multiply this matrix

93
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,538
that we had that was ...

94
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:48,902
See now it's kind of easy to remember

95
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:49,820
what the matrix is, right?

96
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,285
I can just kind of read it off here

97
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:53,785
as two one negative three one,

98
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:58,309
but just to see why it's
actually taking the basis vectors

99
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:00,324
to the columns like this,

100
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,907
when you do the
multiplication by one zero,

101
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,784
notice how it's going to take us to,

102
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,183
so it's two times one, that'll be two,

103
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:14,119
and then, negative three times zero,

104
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,088
so that'll just be zero,

105
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:18,040
and over here, it's one times one,

106
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,327
so that's one, and then, one times zero,

107
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,577
so again we're adding zero.

108
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:25,320
The only terms that actually matter

109
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,840
because of the zero down here,

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,408
was everything in that first column.

111
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:32,926
Similarly, if we take that same matrix,

112
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:35,176
two one negative three one,

113
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:39,545
and we multiply it by zero one over here,

114
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,795
by the second basis vector,

115
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:46,151
what you're going to get,

116
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:48,917
is two times zero, so zero,

117
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,588
plus that element in that second column,

118
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,964
and then, one times zero, so another zero,

119
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:57,561
plus one times one, plus that one.

120
00:04:57,561 --> 00:04:59,561
Again, it's kind of like
that zero knocks out

121
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:02,394
all of the terms in other columns.

122
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,524
Then, like I said, geometrically,

123
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:07,308
the meaning of a linear transformation

124
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,380
is that grid lines remain
parallel and evenly spaced.

125
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,932
When you start to think
about it a little bit,

126
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:14,237
if you can know where
the screen vector lands

127
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:15,947
and where the spread vector lands,

128
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:17,659
that's going to lock into place

129
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:20,332
where the entire grid has to go.

130
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:22,350
Let me show you what I mean
and how this corresponds with,

131
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,116
maybe, a different
definition that you've heard

132
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,099
for what linear transformation means.

133
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:29,309
If we have some kind of function L,

134
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:31,500
and it's going to take in a
vector and spit out a vector,

135
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,985
it's said to be linear if
it satisfies the property

136
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:38,796
that when you take a
constant times a vector,

137
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,379
what it produces is
that same constant times

138
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,320
whatever would have
happened if you applied

139
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,651
that transformation to the
vector, not scaled, right,

140
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,244
so here you're applying
that transformation

141
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:50,684
to a scaled vector,

142
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,652
and evidently, that's the same

143
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,308
as scaling the
transformation of the vector.

144
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:57,412
Similarly, second property of linearity

145
00:05:57,412 --> 00:06:00,003
is that if you add two vectors,

146
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:01,964
it doesn't really matter if you add them

147
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:04,740
before or after the transformation.

148
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,740
If you take the sum of the vectors

149
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,404
then apply the transformation,

150
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:10,619
that's the same as first
applying the transformation

151
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:13,319
to each one separately,

152
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,902
and then adding up the results.

153
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,319
One of the most important consequences

154
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,639
of this formal definition of linearity,

155
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,712
is that it means if you take your function

156
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:28,629
and apply it to some vector x y,

157
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,564
I can split up that vector

158
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:38,693
as x times the first basis vector,

159
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:40,026
x times one zero

160
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:43,595
plus y,

161
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:49,970
let's see y, times that
second basis vector,

162
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,644
zero one,

163
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,893
and because of these two
properties of linearity,

164
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:02,140
if I can split it up like this,

165
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,172
it doesn't matter if I
do the scaling and adding

166
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:05,748
before the transformation,

167
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:07,452
or if I do that scaling and adding

168
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:08,996
after the transformation,

169
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:13,176
and say that it's x times
whatever the transformed version

170
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,426
of one zero is,

171
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,904
and I'll show you
geometrically what this means

172
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,288
in just a moment, but
I kind of want to get

173
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:22,839
all the algebra on the screen,

174
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:25,839
plus y times the transformed version

175
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:30,263
of zero one,

176
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:31,096
zero one.

177
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:34,870
To be concrete, let's actually put in

178
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,591
a value for x and y here,

179
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:40,196
and try to think about that
specific vector geometrically.

180
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:44,898
Maybe I'll put in something
like vector two one.

181
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,170
If we look over on the grid,

182
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,170
we're going to be focusing
on the point that's over here

183
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,011
at two one, and this particular point.

184
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:52,563
I'm going to play the transformation,

185
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:55,635
and I want you to follow this
point to see where it lands,

186
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:58,552
and it's going to end up over here.

187
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,458
Okay, so, in terms of the old grid, right,

188
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,778
the original one that we started with,

189
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:05,914
it's now at the point one three.

190
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,594
This is where we've ended up,

191
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:09,949
but importantly, I want you
to notice how it's still

192
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,389
two times that green vector
plus one times that red vector.

193
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:16,221
It's satisfying that
property that it's still

194
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,437
x times whatever the transformed version

195
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:20,310
of that first basis vector is,

196
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,525
plus y times the transformed version

197
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,858
of that second basis vector.

198
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:27,458
That's all just a little overview,

199
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,403
and the upshot,

200
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:30,354
the main thing I want you
to remember from all of this

201
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:32,842
is when you have some kind of matrix,

202
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:35,154
you can think of it as a
transformation of space

203
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:37,474
that keeps grid lines
parallel and evenly spaced.

204
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,498
That's a very special
kind of transformation.

205
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:42,081
That is a very restrictive
property to have

206
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:45,784
on a function from 2-D
points to other 2-D points.

207
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:47,816
The convenient way to encode that,

208
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:50,744
is that the landing spot
for that first basis vector,

209
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:52,777
the one that started off
one unit to the right,

210
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:55,457
is represented with the
first column of the matrix,

211
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,848
and the landing spot for
the second basis vector,

212
00:08:57,848 --> 00:08:59,960
the one that was pointing one unit up,

213
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,877
is encoded with that second column.

214
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:05,681
If this feels totally unfamiliar,

215
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:06,961
or you want to learn more about this,

216
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,801
it's something that I've made
other videos on in the past,

217
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,065
but in terms of understanding
the Jacobian matrix,

218
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:13,147
where we're going with this,

219
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:15,225
and kind of getting a
geometric feel for it,

220
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:16,554
that short overview that I gave

221
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:19,457
should be enough to get us going.

222
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,129
With that, I will see you next video.
