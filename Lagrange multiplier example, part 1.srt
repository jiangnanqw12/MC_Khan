1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,640
so let's say you're running some kind of

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,200
company and you guys produce widgets you

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,599
produce some little trinket that people

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,160
enjoy buying and the main costs that you

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,679
have are labor

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,360
you know the the workers that you have

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,360
creating these and steal

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,160
and let's just say that your labor costs

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,480
are twenty dollars per hour

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,359
twenty dollars each hour

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,840
and then your steel costs are

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,119
uh two thousand dollars keep the numbers

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,719
kind of related to each other two

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,239
thousand dollars for every ton of steel

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,520
and then you've had your analysts work a

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,680
little bit on trying to model the

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,239
revenues you can make with your widgets

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,399
as a function of hours of labor and tons

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,320
of steel now let's say the revenue model

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,120
that they've come up with the revenue as

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,879
a function of you know hours of labor

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,840
and then s for steel let's say

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,960
is equal to about you know 100 times the

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,840
hours of labor to the power two-thirds

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,840
multiplied by the tons of steel to the

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,280
power one-third

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,960
if you put in a given amount of labor

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,479
and a given amount of steel this is

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,000
about how much money you're going to

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,280
expect to earn

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
and of course you want to earn as much

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,080
as you can let's say you actually have a

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,920
budget for how much you're able to spend

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,920
on all these things and your budget

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,799
the budget

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,880
is

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,640
twenty thousand dollars

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,799
you're willing to spend twenty thousand

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,799
dollars and you wanna make as much money

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,000
as you can according to this model based

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,159
on that

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
now this is exactly the kind of problem

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
that the lagrange multiplier technique

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,439
is made for we're trying to maximize

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
some kind of function and we have a

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,439
constraint now right now the constraint

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,280
isn't written as a formula but we can

48
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,280
pretty easily write it as a formula

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
because what makes up our budget well

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
it's going to be the number of hours of

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,640
labor multiplied by 20 so that's going

52
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,280
to be

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,280
20 dollars per hour multiplied by the

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,680
number of hours you put in

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,000
plus 2000

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,640
dollars per tons of steel

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,799
times the tons of steel that you put in

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
so the constraint

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,720
is basically that

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
you have to have these values equal

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
twenty thousand dollars i mean you could

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
say less than right you could say you're

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,000
not willing to go any more than that but

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,680
intuitively and in reality it's going to

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,280
be the case that in order to maximize

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,879
your revenues you should squeeze every

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,800
dollar that you have available and

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,160
actually hit this constraint so this

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,760
right here is the constraint of our

70
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,280
problem and let's go ahead and give this

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
guy a name the function that we're

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,720
dealing with a name

73
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,599
and i'm going to call it g

74
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,360
of

75
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,440
h s

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,800
which is going to be that guy

77
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,480
and now if you'll remember in the last

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
few videos the way we visualize

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,280
something like this is to think about

80
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,640
the set of all possible inputs so in

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
this case you know you might be thinking

82
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,120
about the hs plane

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
you know the number of hours of labor on

84
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,360
one axis the number of tons of steel on

85
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,879
another and this constraint well in this

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,319
case it's a it's a linear function so

87
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,200
this constraint is going to give us some

88
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,120
kind of line that tells us which pairs

89
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,120
of s and h are going to achieve that

90
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,560
constraint and then the revenue function

91
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,440
that we're dealing with will have

92
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,480
certain contours you know maybe revenues

93
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,920
of

94
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,200
ten thousand dollars have a certain

95
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
contour that looks like this and

96
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,920
revenues of a hundred thousand dollars

97
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,400
have a certain contour that looks like

98
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,239
this but what we want is to find which

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
value is barely touching the constraint

100
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,080
curve

101
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,360
just tangent to it at a given point

102
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,519
because that's going to be the contour

103
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,440
line where if you up the value by just a

104
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,040
little bit it would no longer intersect

105
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,120
with that curve there would no longer be

106
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,200
values of h and s that satisfy this

107
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
constraint

108
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,280
and the way to think about finding that

109
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,239
tangency is to consider the

110
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,920
vector perpendicular to the tangent line

111
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,840
to the curve at that point which

112
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,480
fortunately is represented by let's see

113
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,480
let me make some room for myself here

114
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,360
represented by the gradient

115
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,120
the gradient of our our r function the

116
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,159
the function whose contours this is the

117
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,840
revenue

118
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,360
and what it means for this to be tangent

119
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,760
to the constraint line

120
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,360
is that there's going to be

121
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,120
another vector the gradient of g of our

122
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,640
constraint function

123
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
that points in the same direction that's

124
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,239
proportional to that and typically the

125
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,680
way you write this is to say that the

126
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,799
gradient

127
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,400
of this function is proportional to

128
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,519
proportional to

129
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,199
the gradient of g

130
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,080
and this proportionality constant is

131
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,160
called our lagrange multiplier

132
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,720
it's called

133
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,440
the lagrange

134
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
multiplier

135
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,040
so let's go ahead and start working it

136
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,160
out let's first compute the gradient of

137
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
r

138
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
so the gradient of r

139
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,600
is going to be the partial derivative of

140
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,759
r with respect to its first variable

141
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,560
which is h so partial derivative with

142
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,320
respect to h and the second component is

143
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,320
its partial derivative with respect to

144
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,160
that second variable s

145
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,400
with respect to s

146
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,479
and in this case

147
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,320
that first partial derivative if we

148
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,160
treat h as a variable and s as a

149
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,960
constant then that two-thirds gets

150
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,240
brought down so that'll be 100

151
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,440
times

152
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,960
two-thirds times h

153
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,800
h to the power of well we've got to

154
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,960
subtract one from two-thirds when we

155
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,400
bring it down so that'll be negative

156
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,479
one-third

157
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
multiplied by s

158
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,479
to the one-third

159
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,720
and then the second component here the

160
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,280
partial derivative with respect to s

161
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,199
is going to be 100 times well now by

162
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,039
treating s as the variable we take down

163
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,240
that one-third so that's

164
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,840
one-third

165
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,080
h to the two-thirds just looks like a

166
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,560
constant as far as s is concerned and

167
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,960
then we take s to the one-third minus

168
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,400
one which is negative

169
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,479
two-thirds

170
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,320
negative two-thirds

171
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,880
great so that's the gradient of r and

172
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,880
now we need the gradient of g

173
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,800
and that one's a lot easier actually

174
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,160
because g is just a linear function so

175
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
when we take the gradient of g

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,240
which is its partial derivative

177
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,160
with respect to h partial h

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,680
and its partial derivative with respect

179
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680
to s partial s

180
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,000
well the partial with respect to h is

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,800
just 20. the function looks like 20

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,440
times h plus something that's a constant

183
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,880
so that ends up being 20.

184
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,520
and then the partial with respect to s

185
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,759
likewise it's just 2 000 because it's

186
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,120
just some constant multiplied by s plus

187
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,240
a bunch of other stuff that looks like

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,600
constants

189
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,919
so that's great

190
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,319
and this means when we set the gradient

191
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,319
of r equal to the gradient of g the pair

192
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,080
of equations that we get

193
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,199
and let me just write it all out again

194
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,520
is we have this top one which i'll call

195
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,720
200 thirds

196
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
times and let's go ahead and do a little

197
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
simplifying while i'm rewriting things

198
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
here so h to the one third

199
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
is

200
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,440
really one over

201
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,919
h to the negative one third sorry is one

202
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,240
over h to the one third and that's s to

203
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,840
the one third so all of this that first

204
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,720
component is being set equal to the

205
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,160
first component of the gradient of g

206
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,160
which is 20

207
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,520
times lambda times this lagrange

208
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,960
multiplier because we're not setting the

209
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,280
gradients equal to each other we're just

210
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,720
setting them proportional to each other

211
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,000
so that's the first equation and then

212
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,520
the second one i'll go ahead and do some

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,599
simplifying while i rewrite that one

214
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,880
also that's going to be

215
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,599
100

216
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,800
thirds and then h to the two thirds so

217
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,400
times

218
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,080
h to the two thirds divided by s to the

219
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,840
two thirds because s to the negative two

220
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,039
thirds is the same as one over s to the

221
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,560
two-thirds

222
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,280
all of that

223
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,080
is equal to two thousand

224
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,240
two

225
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,759
thousand times lambda and the important

226
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,199
thing is it's that same lambda because

227
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,319
the entire vector has to be proportional

228
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,680
and i think right here is probably a

229
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,720
pretty good point to stop and in the

230
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,160
next video i'll go ahead and work

231
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,160
through the details and we'll land on a

232
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,160
solution
