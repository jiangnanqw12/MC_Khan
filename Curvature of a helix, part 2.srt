1
00:00:00,798 --> 00:00:02,015
- [Voiceover] So, where we left off,

2
00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:04,581
we were looking at this,
this parametric function

3
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:06,933
for a three dimensional
curve, and what it draws,

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:10,451
I showed you, was a helix
in three dimensional space.

5
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:12,378
And, we're trying to find it's curvature,

6
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:14,572
which...the way you think about that,

7
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:15,977
you have a circle...

8
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:17,800
You're thinking of the
circle that most closely

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,681
hugs that curve, or you could imagine

10
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:22,734
you're flying a spaceship
and all your instruments

11
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:25,080
lock up when you're turning,
and you're wondering

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,774
what circle in space
you're going to trace out,

13
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,932
and you're looking for one
divided by the radius of that.

14
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:32,417
Or if you prefer my,
you know, kindergartner

15
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:34,576
drawing skills, you could
just look at the helix

16
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,917
over here while we work it through.

17
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:39,584
And, the part where we left off,

18
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,150
we had this tangent vector function.

19
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,830
This unit tangent vector
function for our curve.

20
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,989
So at every given value, T, whatever point

21
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,032
that corresponds to on the curve,

22
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:52,772
this function is going
to give us the vector

23
00:00:52,772 --> 00:00:55,872
that is of unit length
and tangent to the curve.

24
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,287
And the ultimate goal,
for curvature, is to find

25
00:00:58,287 --> 00:01:02,664
the derivative of that
unit tangent vector,

26
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:04,952
with respect to arclength.

27
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:07,227
And specifically we want it's magnitude.

28
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:09,804
And what that typically
requires, and I talked

29
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,604
about this in the videos on the formula,

30
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,553
is you take it's derivative, with respect

31
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,410
to the parameter, T, because

32
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,966
that's the thing you can actually do,

33
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:20,671
and that might not correspond
to unit length, right?

34
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,668
If you nudge the parameter,
T, that might not

35
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:26,070
nudge you a corresponding
length on the curve.

36
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,344
But you correct that by
dividing out, by the derivative

37
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:33,872
of the parameterization
function, with respect to T.

38
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:35,670
And that's actually arclength,

39
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,837
this magnitude of the derivative
of the parameterization

40
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,328
with respect to T.

41
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,023
Boy, is that a hard word.

42
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:46,786
So, with our given
function, let's go ahead

43
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:48,121
and start doing that.

44
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,060
And I think first, given
that we have this kind of

45
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,103
fractions and fractions
form, I'm just going

46
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:55,307
to start by writing it a
little bit more simply.

47
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:57,026
So our unit tangent vector function,

48
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:59,661
that first component,
where we're dividing by

49
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,041
the square root of 26 divided by five,

50
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,038
instead I'm just going to write that as

51
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:07,075
negative five times the sine of t.

52
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:10,337
So, I'm just kind of moving
that five up into the numerator,

53
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:13,855
divided by the root of 26,
and I'll do the same thing

54
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:17,755
for cosine, where we move that
five up into the numerator.

55
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:21,755
Cosine of t, divided by
the root of 26, and then

56
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:26,754
the last part, one fifth
divided by square root

57
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:30,097
of 26 fifths, gives us just one divided

58
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:31,847
by square root of 26.

59
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:38,236
Alright, so the first step in
using our curvature formula

60
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:41,255
is going to be to take the
derivative of this guy, right?

61
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:44,888
We need the derivative of
the tangent vector function.

62
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,595
So, we go ahead and start doing that.

63
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:50,762
We see that d big T, d little
t, so tangent vector function

64
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:54,188
parameter, is equal to, and
we just take the derivative

65
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:56,011
of each component.

66
00:02:56,011 --> 00:03:00,178
So, negative five sine goes
to negative five cosine.

67
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:07,389
And we divide out by the
constant, square root of 26.

68
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:10,593
Similarly, five cosine
goes to negative five sine,

69
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:14,831
since the derivative of
cosine is negative sine.

70
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:18,788
Negative five sine divided
by 26, or square root of 26.

71
00:03:18,788 --> 00:03:21,474
And the last component is just a constant,

72
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:25,026
so derivative is nothing, it's zero.

73
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:27,282
Next step, we're going
to take the magnitude

74
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:28,833
of that vector that we just found.

75
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,969
So we're trying to find the
magnitude of the derivative

76
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:33,210
of the tangent vector function.

77
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,928
So we say alright.

78
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:37,028
Magnitude of what we just found,

79
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,695
d big T, d little t, involves...

80
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:45,331
so this magnitude will
be the square root of,

81
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,815
make the little tic there,
square root of the sum

82
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,208
of the squares of these guys.

83
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:53,794
So the square of that first
component is going to be 25,

84
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:56,394
multiply by cosine squared,

85
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:58,218
cosine squared of t,

86
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:01,097
all divided by 26, right, because the

87
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:04,264
square of the square root of 26 is 26.

88
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:08,970
And then we add to that
25 times sine squared,

89
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:14,694
sine squared of t, also divided by 26.

90
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:21,350
And from that, we can factor out,

91
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,933
factor out 25 over 26,
inside that radical,

92
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,424
because both terms involve
multiplying by 25 and

93
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:32,106
dividing by 26, and what
we're left with is a

94
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,381
nice, and friendly cosine/sine pair.

95
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,901
The reason we love
things involving circles.

96
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,923
This always happens.

97
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,385
Nice cancellation.

98
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:42,133
This just becomes one, so what we're left

99
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:45,300
with on the whole, is root 25 over 26.

100
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,064
Pretty nice.

101
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:51,038
Root 25 over 26.

102
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:53,221
So for a curvature equation, we go up

103
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:55,183
and we can start plugging that in.

104
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:58,193
So we just found that
numerator, and found that it was

105
00:04:58,193 --> 00:05:01,276
the square root of 25, divided by 26.

106
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:06,395
The entire thing, 25 over 26.

107
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:09,354
And we already found the magnitude

108
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:10,688
of the derivative itself.

109
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,407
That's one of the things we needed to do

110
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:13,533
to find the tangent vector.

111
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,950
That's where this 26 over five came from.

112
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,314
I deleted it from where we
did last video to make room,

113
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,089
but if you look at the
last video, you can see

114
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,468
where we got the square
root of 26 divided by five.

115
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:28,208
And I'll actually write
that as square root of

116
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:32,125
26 divided by 25, just
that's how we originally

117
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,113
found it, I'm just putting the
five back under the radical.

118
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:39,225
And it's tempting, if you
aren't looking too closely,

119
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:41,095
to think these guys cancel
out, but it's actually

120
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:42,766
they're the opposite of each other, right?

121
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:46,134
One is 25 over 26 the other is 26 over 25.

122
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:48,549
So if we put everything
under the radical there

123
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,706
it's going to say equals the square root.

124
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:55,873
And we're going to have 25
over 26, divided by 26 over 25

125
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:02,527
and when we flip that bottom and multiply,

126
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:06,527
what we get is 25 squared
divided by 26 squared.

127
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:14,056
And the root of that whole
thing, just gives us 25

128
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:16,973
over 26, and that is our curvature.

129
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:20,232
That right there, is the answer.

130
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:21,567
That is the curvature.

131
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,007
So it's a little bit greater than one.

132
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,156
No, no, sorry.

133
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:25,679
So, it's a little bit less than one,

134
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,233
which means that you're
curving a little bit less

135
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:30,716
than you would if it was
a circle with radius one.

136
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:33,154
Which kind of makes sense if
we look at the image here,

137
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:36,149
because if the helix were
completely flattened out, right,

138
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:38,333
if you imagine squishing
this down onto the xy plane,

139
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,107
you'd just be going around
a circle with radius one.

140
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:42,874
But by kind of pulling that spring and

141
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:44,973
pulling it so that there's a z component,

142
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:47,074
you're making it a
little bit more straight.

143
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,187
So, the curvature should
go down a little bit,

144
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:51,057
because it's becoming a
little bit more straight.

145
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:52,810
The radius of curvature will go up.

146
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,771
So that's the curvature of a helix,

147
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:58,174
and that's a pretty good
example of how you can find

148
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:00,391
the curvature by walking through directly,

149
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:03,050
the idea of finding dt/ds.

150
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,174
And you know, getting
that unit tangent vector.

151
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,276
Getting the little unit arclength.

152
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:10,933
And in the next example, I
think I'll go through one

153
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,755
where you just use the formula.

154
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,648
Where it's something a
little bit more complicated

155
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,214
than thinking about this and
you turn to the formula itself.

156
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:18,366
And I'll see you then.
