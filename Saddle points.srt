1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,226
- [Voiceover] In the last video,

2
00:00:01,226 --> 00:00:03,109
I talked about how if
you're trying to maximize

3
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:05,168
or minimize a multi-variable function,

4
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:07,012
you can imagine it's graph.

5
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:08,828
In this case, this is just
a two-variable function

6
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:10,122
and we're looking at it's graph.

7
00:00:10,122 --> 00:00:11,487
And you want to find the spots

8
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:14,221
where the tangent plane
is completely flat.

9
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:16,696
So one way to visualize this
is to imagine a flat plane

10
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:18,769
that just represents a constant Z value,

11
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,965
so a constant output
value for the function.

12
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:22,629
And if you kind of move it up and down,

13
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:25,797
you're looking for the spot
where it only barely intersects

14
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:28,014
with the graph at the top
before it's not intersecting

15
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:30,344
with it anymore, meaning
that there's no values

16
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:32,220
of the function that get above that point.

17
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,350
So you're looking just
for where it's tangent,

18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,306
where you can find a
tangent plane that's flat.

19
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:38,043
But this will give you some other points,

20
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:41,116
like the little local minima here,

21
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:43,347
the bumps where the value of the function

22
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:45,128
at that point is higher than
all of the neighbor points.

23
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,387
You know, if you walk in any direction,

24
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:47,990
you're going downhill,
so that's another thing

25
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,633
you're gonna incidentally pick up

26
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,962
by looking for places where
this tangent plane is flat,

27
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:55,356
but there's also a really
interesting new possibility

28
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,723
that comes up in the context
of multi-variable functions.

29
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:00,106
And this is the idea of a saddle point.

30
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:03,430
So let me pull up another
graph here, this guy.

31
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,352
And the function that you're looking at,

32
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:07,011
here, I'll write it down, the function

33
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:11,178
that you're looking at is f(x,y)=x2-y2.

34
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:17,862
So now let's think about
what the tangent plane

35
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:20,939
at the origin of this
entire graph would be.

36
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,529
Now the tangent plane to this graph

37
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,323
at the origin is actually flat.

38
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:25,873
Here's what it looks like.

39
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:27,042
And to convince yourself of this,

40
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:29,031
let's go ahead and actually
compute the partial derivatives

41
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:32,362
of this function and evaluate
each one at the origin.

42
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:35,027
So the partial derivative,
with respect to X,

43
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:37,007
we look here and
X-squared is the only spot

44
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:39,083
where an X shows up, so it's 2X

45
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,787
and the other partial derivative.

46
00:01:40,787 --> 00:01:42,564
The partial with respect to Y,

47
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:47,408
we take the derivative of
this negative Y-squared

48
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,404
and we ignore the X because it looks

49
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,139
like a constant as far as Y is concerned.

50
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,231
And we get negative 2Y.

51
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:56,285
Now, if we plug in the point, the origin,

52
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:58,255
in to any one of these, you know,

53
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:01,904
we plug in the point (X,Y)=(0,0),

54
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:04,866
then what do each of these go to?

55
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,450
Well the top one, X equals zero,

56
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,870
so this guy goes to zero
and similarly over here,

57
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,522
Y is zero, so this goes to zero.

58
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:13,097
So both partial derivatives are zero

59
00:02:13,097 --> 00:02:14,403
and what that means is if you are standing

60
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:17,045
at the origin and you
move in any direction,

61
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:19,464
there's no slope to your movement.

62
00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:22,181
And one way of seeing
this is to chop the graph.

63
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:24,242
So if we imagine chopping it with a plane

64
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:25,800
that represents a constant X-value

65
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,912
and we kind of chop off the graph there,

66
00:02:27,912 --> 00:02:30,548
what you'll see, here, I'll
get rid of the tangent plane.

67
00:02:30,548 --> 00:02:32,162
What you'll see is that the curve

68
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:33,659
where this intersects the graphs,

69
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,341
let me trace that out, the curve

70
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:36,748
where it intersects the graph

71
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:40,960
basically has a local
maximum at that origin point.

72
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,016
The tangent line of
the curve at that point

73
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:46,260
in the Y direction is flat
and it's because it looks

74
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,306
like a local maximum
from that perspective.

75
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:50,887
But now let's imagine chopping
it in a different direction.

76
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:52,700
So if instead, we have the full graph

77
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,087
and instead of chopping it
with a constant X value,

78
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:57,123
we chop it with a constant Y value,

79
00:02:57,123 --> 00:03:00,042
then in that case, we look at the curve

80
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:02,239
and if we trace out the curve

81
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,355
where this constant Y
value intersects the graph.

82
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:07,287
Let's see what it would look like.

83
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,472
It's also kind of this parabolic shape.

84
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:12,178
Again, the tangent line is flat

85
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:15,762
because it looks like a
local minimum of that curve.

86
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,951
So because it's flat in one direction

87
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:19,485
and it's flat in the other direction,

88
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:20,908
the tangent plane of the graph

89
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,953
as a whole is indeed gonna be flat.

90
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,912
But notice this is neither a local maximum

91
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:28,202
nor a local minimum
because from one direction,

92
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:32,089
from one direction, it looked
like it was a local maximum.

93
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:33,992
Here, I'll get rid of that guy.

94
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:35,366
It looks like it's a local maximum

95
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:36,955
when you look on the curve there,

96
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,175
but from another direction,
if you chop it another way,

97
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:41,169
it looks like a local minimum.

98
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,455
And if we look at the equations,

99
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,182
this kind of makes sense
because if you're just thinking

100
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:46,950
about movements in the X direction,

101
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,384
the entire function looks like X- squared

102
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:51,282
plus some kind of constant.

103
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:53,150
So the graph of that would look

104
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,366
like an X-squared parabola shape

105
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:57,376
that has a local minimum,
but if you're thinking

106
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:59,365
of pure movements in the Y direction

107
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,761
and you're just focused on
that Y-squared component,

108
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:04,514
the graph that you get for
negative Y-squared is gonna look

109
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:06,626
like an upside down parabola.

110
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:07,898
Here, I'll draw that again.

111
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:10,110
It's gonna look like
an upside down parabola

112
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,891
and that's got a local maximum.

113
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:15,081
So it's kind of like the X
and Y directions disagree

114
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:17,918
over whether this point,
whether this point

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,008
where you have a flat tangent plane

116
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,862
should be a local maximum
or a local minimum.

117
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,340
And this is new to
multi-variable calculus,

118
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,097
this is something that doesn't come up

119
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:28,770
in single-variable calculus because

120
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,224
when you're looking at
the graph of a function,

121
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:31,734
you know, you're looking
at some kind of graph.

122
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:35,251
If the tangent line is zero, you know,

123
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,493
if the tangent line is
completely flat at some point,

124
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:40,170
either it's a local maximum
or it's local minimum.

125
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,958
It can't disagree because
there's only one input variable.

126
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,670
There's only one X as the
input variable for your graph.

127
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,337
But once we have two, it's
possible that they disagree.

128
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:51,911
And this kind of point has a special name

129
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:53,960
and the name is kind of after this graph

130
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,075
that you're looking at,
it's called a saddle point.

131
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:57,158
Saddle point.

132
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:01,289
And this is one of those rare times

133
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:02,925
where I actually kind
of like the terminology

134
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:04,974
that mathematicians have given something.

135
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:06,480
Because this looks like a saddle,

136
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,016
the sort of thing that you would put

137
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,232
on a horse's back before riding it.

138
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:10,501
So one thing that this means for us

139
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,107
as we're gonna try to figure out ways

140
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:15,548
to find the absolute maximum
or minimum of a function,

141
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,617
as we're trying to optimize a function

142
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,503
that might represent like
profits of your company

143
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,767
or a cost function in a
machine learning setting

144
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:24,532
or something like that,
is we're gonna have

145
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,258
to be able to recognize if
a point is a saddle point.

146
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:29,351
And if you're just looking
at the graph, that's fine.

147
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,687
You can recognize it visually,

148
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:32,930
but oftentimes if you're
just given the formula

149
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,544
of a function and it's some long thing.

150
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,120
Without looking at the graph,

151
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,700
how would you be able to tell,

152
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,892
just by doing certain
computations to the formula,

153
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:42,513
whether or not it's a saddle point?

154
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:44,054
And that comes down to something

155
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:46,163
called the second partial derivative test,

156
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:48,052
which I will talk about
in the next few videos.

157
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:49,135
See you then!
