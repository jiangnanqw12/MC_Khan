00:00:00,877 --> 00:00:02,949
- [Voiceover] So I wanna give
you guys just one more example

2
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:04,798
of a transformation before we move on

3
00:00:04,798 --> 00:00:08,048
to the actual calculus of
multi variable calculus.

4
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:09,938
In the video on parametric surfaces

5
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:12,133
I gave you guys this function here.

6
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,124
Its a very complicated looking function

7
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:15,465
its got a two dimensional input

8
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:17,050
and a three dimensional output

9
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,553
and I talked about how
you can think about it

10
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:21,621
as drawing a surface in
three dimensional space

11
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,185
and that one came out to be the surface

12
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:26,944
of a doughnut which we also call a torus.

13
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,570
So what I wanna do here is talk about

14
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,662
how you might think of
this as a transformation

15
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:32,104
and first let me just get straight

16
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:34,380
what the input space here is.

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,331
So the input space you
could think about it

18
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:39,434
as the entire T,S plane, right?

19
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:42,752
We might draw this as the entire T axis

20
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:46,652
and the S axis

21
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:49,073
and just everything here
and see where it maps.

22
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:51,325
But you can actually go to
just a small subset of that.

23
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:54,921
So if you limit yourself
to T going between zero

24
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,754
so between zero and lets say 2 pi

25
00:00:59,147 --> 00:01:04,003
and then similarly with S
going from zero up to 2 pi

26
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:06,685
can you imagine what, you know

27
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:09,570
that would be sort of a square region.

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,419
Just limiting yourself to that

29
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:12,963
you're actually gonna
get all of the points

30
00:01:12,963 --> 00:01:15,686
that you need to draw the torus.

31
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:17,230
And the basic reason for that is that

32
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,384
as T ranges from zero to 2 pi

33
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:21,314
the cosine of T goes over its full range

34
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,935
before it starts becoming periodic.

35
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:26,982
Sine of T does the same
and same deal with S.

36
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:29,461
If you let S range from zero to 2 pi

37
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:30,985
that covers a full period of cosine

38
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:32,691
a full period of sine

39
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,353
so you'll get no new
information by going elsewhere.

40
00:01:35,353 --> 00:01:36,836
So what we can do is
think about this portion

41
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:39,274
of the T,S plane kind of as living inside

42
00:01:39,274 --> 00:01:41,466
three dimensional space
as a sort of cheating

43
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:43,282
but its a little bit easier to do this

44
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:44,966
than to imagine moving from

45
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:47,462
some separate area into the space.

46
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:48,986
At the very least for
the animation efforts

47
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:51,524
its easier to just start it off in 3D.

48
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:52,704
So what I'm thinking about here

49
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:55,813
this square is representing that T,S plane

50
00:01:55,813 --> 00:01:58,048
and for this function which is taking all

51
00:01:58,048 --> 00:02:00,120
of the points in this square as its input

52
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,294
and outputs a point in
three dimensional space

53
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:03,879
you can think about how those points

54
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,379
move to their corresponding output points.

55
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,437
So I'll show that again.

56
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:13,509
We start off with our T,S plane here

57
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,419
and then whatever your input point is

58
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,573
if you were to follow it, and you were to

59
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:20,559
follow it through this
whole transformation

60
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,469
the place where it lands would be

61
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,517
the corresponding output of this function.

62
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:26,756
And one thing I should mention is

63
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:29,072
all of the interpolating values

64
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:31,795
as you go in between
these don't really matter.

65
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:33,989
Their function is really
a very static thing

66
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,021
there's just an input
and there's an output.

67
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:37,850
And if I'm thinking in terms of

68
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,211
a transformation actually moving it

69
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:42,238
there's a little bit of magic sauce

70
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:45,022
that has to go into making
an animation do this

71
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:46,159
and in this case I kind of put it

72
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,643
into two different phases to sort of

73
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:49,878
roll up one side and roll up the other

74
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,377
it doesn't really matter
but the general idea

75
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,835
of starting with a square
and somehow warping that

76
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:56,745
however you do choose to warp it

77
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:58,675
is actually a pretty powerful thought.

78
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:00,239
And as we get into multi variable calculus

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,840
and you start thinking a little
more deeply about surfaces

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,587
I think it really helps if you think about

81
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:07,391
what a slight little movement over here

82
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:10,764
on your input space would look like

83
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:12,999
what happens to that tiny little movement

84
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,563
or that tiny little traversal

85
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,392
what it looks like if
you do that same movement

86
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:18,363
somewhere on the output space.

87
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:20,618
And you'll get lots of
chances to wrap your mind

88
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,198
about this and engage with the idea.

89
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:25,128
But here I just want to get
your minds churning on this

90
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:28,558
pretty neat way of viewing
what functions are doing.
