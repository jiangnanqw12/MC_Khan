1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,359
all of the work we've been doing so far

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,680
with line integrals has been with scalar

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,360
functions or scalar valued functions and

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,559
when i say that that just means you give

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,240
me an x and a y and you evaluate the

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,240
function at that x and y and you get

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,880
another scalar value you get it just a

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,359
number you don't get a vector so what i

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,519
want to do in this video is start to get

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,359
ourselves warmed up with regards to

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,199
vectors so that we can understand what

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,240
it means to take a line integral with

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,840
vector valued functions so let me write

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,960
down some vector valued functions

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,920
actually even a better place to start

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,920
let me

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,840
let me draw a curve or let me describe a

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
curve so let's put that little f of x y

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,320
to the side we can ignore it for now

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,680
let's say i have some curve c

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,120
and it's described it can be parameter

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,399
parameterized i i can't say that word as

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,280
let's say x

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,559
is equal to x of t

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
y

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,399
is equal to some function y of t

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,760
and let's say that this is valid for t

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,360
is between a and b so t is greater than

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,640
or equal to a

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,400
and then less than or equal to b so if i

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,200
were to just draw this

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
on

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,680
let me say i could draw it like this i'm

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,840
staying very abstract

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,240
right now this is not a very specific

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,680
example this is the x-axis this is the

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,360
y-axis my curve let's say this is when t

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,560
is equal to

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,640
a and then the curve might do something

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
might do something like this

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,799
i don't know what it does let's say it's

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,200
over there this is t is equal to

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,520
b this actual point right here will be x

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,640
of b that would be the x coordinate you

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,159
evaluate this function at b and y

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,240
of b

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,920
and this is of course when t is equal to

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,600
a the actual coordinate in r2 on this on

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,640
the cartesian coordinates will be x of a

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,079
which is this right here and then y

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,240
of a which is that right there and we've

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,079
seen that before that's just a standard

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,520
way of describing a parametric equation

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,599
or curve using two parametric equations

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,520
what i want to do now is describe this

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,720
same exact curve

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,520
using a vector valued function so if i

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
define a vector valued function and if

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
you don't remember what those are we'll

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,959
have a little bit of review here let me

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,040
say i have a vector valued function r

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,959
and i'll put a little vector

63
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,040
arrow on top of it in a lot of textbooks

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
they'll just bold it and they'll leave

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,800
scalar valued functions unbolded but

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,480
it's hard to to draw a bold so i'll put

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,200
a little vector on top

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,640
and let's say that r is a function of t

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
and these are going to be position

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,840
vectors

71
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,160
position vectors

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,480
position

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,400
position vectors and i'm specifying that

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,560
because in general when someone talks

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,720
about a vector this vector

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,319
and this vector are considered

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,159
equivalent as long as they have the same

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,920
magnitude and direction no one really

79
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,760
cares about what their start and end

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,519
points are as long as their direction is

81
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,120
the same and their length is the same

82
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,720
but when you talk about position vectors

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,800
you're saying no these vectors are all

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,879
going to start at

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,879
zero at the origin and when you say it's

86
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,120
a position vector you're implicitly

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,800
saying this is specifying a unique

88
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,319
position in this case it's going to be

89
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,760
in two-dimensional space but it could be

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,519
in three-dimensional space or really

91
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,120
even four-five whatever n-dimensional

92
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,360
space so when you say the position

93
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,400
vector you're literally saying okay this

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,440
vector literally specifies that point in

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,440
space

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,560
so let's let's see if we can describe

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,640
this curve

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,840
as a vector a a position vector valued

99
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,440
function

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
so we could say r of t let me switch

101
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,840
back to that pink color

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,239
i'll just stay in green is equal to x of

103
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,920
t times the unit vector in the x

104
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
direction the unit vector gets a little

105
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,360
carrot on top a little hat that's like

106
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
the arrow for it that just says it's a

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,159
unit vector

108
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,840
plus

109
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,040
y of t

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,680
y of t

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,120
times j if i had if i was dealing with a

112
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,200
curve in three dimensions i would have

113
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,439
plus z of t times k but we're dealing

114
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,879
with two dimensions right here and so

115
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,879
the way this works is you're just taking

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,280
your well for any t and you know and

117
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,160
still we're going to have t is

118
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,320
t is greater than or equal to a and then

119
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,160
less than or equal to b and this is the

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,000
exact same thing as that let me just

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,160
redraw it so let me draw our coordinates

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,840
our coordinates right here

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
our

124
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,360
axes so that's the y-axis and this is

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,120
the x-axis so when you evaluate r of a

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,080
right that's our starting point so let

127
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,080
me do that so r of a maybe i'll do it

128
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,240
right over here

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,199
our position vector valued function

130
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,040
evaluated at t is equal to a

131
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,080
is going to be equal to

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
x

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,000
of a

134
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,840
times our unit vector in the x direction

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,919
plus y of a times our unit vector in the

136
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,240
vertical direction or in the y direction

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,919
and what's that going to look like well

138
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
x of a

139
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,600
it's going x of a is this thing right

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,680
here so it's x of a times the unit

141
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,880
vector so it's really you know maybe the

142
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,080
unit vector is this long it has length 1

143
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,320
so now we're just going to have a length

144
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,479
of x of a in that direction and then

145
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,400
same thing in y of a it's going to be y

146
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,000
of a length in that direction but the

147
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,039
bottom line this vector right here if

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,600
you add these scaled values of these two

149
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,280
unit vectors you're going to get you're

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,320
going to get r of a looking something

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,680
like this

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,320
it's going to be a vector that looks

153
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,919
something like that

154
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,600
just like that it's a vector it's a

155
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,520
position vector that's why we're nailing

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,560
it at the origin but drawing it in

157
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,240
standard position and that right there

158
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,360
is

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
r

160
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,639
of a

161
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,600
now what happens if a increases a little

162
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,280
bit what is r of a plus a little bit and

163
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,400
i don't know we could call that r of a

164
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,560
plus delta or r of a plus h

165
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,960
we do a different color so let's say r

166
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,840
let's say we increase a a little bit r

167
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
of a

168
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,919
plus some small h well that's just going

169
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,759
to be x of

170
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,639
a plus h times the unit vector i

171
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,560
plus y times a plus h times the unit

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,240
vector j and what's that going to look

173
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,600
like well we're going to go a little bit

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,840
further down the curve that's like

175
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
saying the coordinate x of a plus h and

176
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,759
y plus a plus h which might be that

177
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,720
point right there so we'll go to it'll

178
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,440
be a new unit vector it'll be a u a new

179
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,199
unit vector sorry it'll be a new vector

180
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,039
position vector not a unit vector these

181
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,280
don't necessarily have length 1 that

182
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,520
might be right here

183
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,160
let me do that same color as this

184
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,919
so it might be just like

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,720
just like that

186
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,000
so that right here is r

187
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,479
of a plus h so you see as you keep

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,199
increasing your value of t until you get

189
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,120
to b these these position vectors are

190
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
going to keep specifying

191
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,720
we're going to keep specifying points

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,039
along this curve so the curve let me

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,199
draw the curve in a different color

194
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,720
the curve looks something like this it's

195
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,599
meant to look exactly like the curve

196
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,919
that i have up here and for example r of

197
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,680
b is going to be is going to be a vector

198
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,919
that looks like this it's going to be a

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,319
vector that looks like

200
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,080
that let me i want to draw it relatively

201
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,680
straight

202
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,800
that vector

203
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,880
right there

204
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,440
is r

205
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,199
r of b so hopefully you realize that

206
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,440
look these position vectors really are

207
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,440
specifying the same points on this curve

208
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,479
as this original i guess straight up

209
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,840
parametrization that we did for this

210
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,039
curve and i just want to do that as a

211
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,360
little bit of review because we're now

212
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,000
going to break in into the idea of

213
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,319
actually taking a derivative of this

214
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,800
vector valued function and i'll do that

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,800
in the next video
