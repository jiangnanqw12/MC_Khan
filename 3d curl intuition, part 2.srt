1
00:00:00,496 --> 00:00:01,329
- [Voiceover] So where we left off,

2
00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:03,770
I had this two-dimensional vector field V,

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,703
and I have it pictured here as
kind of a yellow vector field

4
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:08,423
and I just stuck it in three dimensions

5
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,495
in kind of an awkward way
where I put it on the XY plane

6
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:12,727
and said pretend this
is in three dimensions.

7
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:14,550
And then when you describe the rotation,

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,356
around each point what we
were familiar with is 2D curl,

9
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:20,772
that's where you get this
vector field, it's not quite

10
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,676
a 3D vector field because
you're only assigning

11
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:25,308
points on the XY plane to
three dimensional vectors,

12
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:27,404
rather than every point
in space to a vector,

13
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:28,757
but we're getting there.

14
00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:30,061
So here let's actually
extend this to a fully

15
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:32,380
three dimensional vector field,

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,882
and first of all let me just kind of

17
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:37,308
clear up the board from the computations

18
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:39,308
we did in the last part.

19
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:42,270
And as I do that kind
of start thinking about

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,527
how you might want to
extend the vector field

21
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:47,518
that I have here that's
pretty much two dimensional

22
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:49,303
into three dimensions.

23
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:52,880
And one idea you might, we'll
kind of get rid of the circles

24
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,693
and the plane, is to
take this vector field

25
00:00:56,693 --> 00:01:00,028
and then just kind of copy
it to different slices.

26
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:03,071
So, you might get something
kind of like this.

27
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:05,290
And then, I've drawn each
slice a little bit sparser

28
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,431
than the original one, so
technically that original

29
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:08,685
one if you look on the XY plane

30
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:10,541
I've pictured many more vectors,

31
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,381
but it's really the same vector field,

32
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:15,519
and all I've done here is
said at every slice in space,

33
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,007
just copy that same vector field.

34
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:20,317
So if you look from above,
you can maybe see how really

35
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:22,654
it's just the same vector
field kind of copied a bunch,

36
00:01:22,654 --> 00:01:25,661
and if you look at it each
slice, you know in the same way

37
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:28,379
that in the XY plane,
you've got this vector field

38
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,762
sitting on the slice,
every other part of space

39
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:32,298
will have that.

40
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:35,459
And even though there's only
what, like six or seven slices

41
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,379
displayed here, in principal
you're thinking that

42
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,885
every one of those infinitely
many slices of space

43
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:42,288
has a copy of this vector field.

44
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:44,731
And in a formula, what does that mean?

45
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,691
Well what it means is
what it means is that

46
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,790
we're taking not just X
and Y as input points,

47
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,235
But we're gonna start taking Z in as well.

48
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:55,891
So if I go, I'm gonna say that
Z is an input point as well.

49
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:57,011
And I want to be considering these

50
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:58,460
as vectors in three dimensions,

51
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,677
so rather than just saying
that that it's got X and Y

52
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:05,008
components, I'm gonna pretend
like it has a Z component

53
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:08,823
that just happens to
be zero for this case.

54
00:02:08,823 --> 00:02:12,032
And the fact that you
have a Z in the input,

55
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,104
but the output doesn't depend on the Z,

56
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:16,743
corresponds to the fact that
all the slices are the same,

57
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:18,263
as you change the Z direction

58
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,504
the vectors won't change at all,

59
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:21,487
they're just carbon copies of each other.

60
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:24,047
And the fact this output
has a Z component,

61
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:26,393
but it just happens to be
zero is what corresponds

62
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:28,222
to the fact that it's very flat looking,

63
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:30,569
you know, none of them point
up or down in the Z direction,

64
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,167
they're all purely X and Y.

65
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,621
So, as three dimensional vector fields go,

66
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,559
this one is only barely a
three dimensional vector field,

67
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:39,701
it's kind of phoning it in
as far as three dimensional

68
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,808
vector fields are concerned,

69
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:42,809
but it'll be quite good
for our example here,

70
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:46,148
because now if we start
thinking of this as representing

71
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:49,527
a three dimensional fluid
flow, so now rather than

72
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:51,561
just kind of the fluid
flow like the one I have

73
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:54,185
pictured over here, where
you've got water molecules

74
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:56,224
moving in two dimensions
and it's very easy to

75
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:59,184
understand clockwise rotation,
counter clockwise rotation,

76
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:01,880
things like that, whereas
over here it's a very

77
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,409
kind of chaotic three
dimensional fluid flow,

78
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,523
but because it's so flat
if you view it from above

79
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:08,993
it's still loosely the same just kind of

80
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:10,799
counter clockwise over here on the right,

81
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,766
and clockwise like there above,

82
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:13,775
so if I were to draw like a column,

83
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,941
you could think of this column as being,

84
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:18,232
having a tornado of fluid flow, right,

85
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,319
where it's, everything is
kind of rotating together

86
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,855
in that same direction.

87
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:24,760
So if you were to assign a
vector to each point in space

88
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,992
to describe the kind of rotation happening

89
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:29,122
around each one of those points in space,

90
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:31,104
you would expect that
those inside this column,

91
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:34,552
inside this sort of counter
clockwise rotating tornado,

92
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:36,276
and I say counter
clockwise, but if we viewed

93
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:37,746
it from below it would look clockwise,

94
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:39,581
so that's the tricky part
about three dimensions

95
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:41,329
and why we need to
describe it with vectors,

96
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,616
but you expect these using
your right hand rule,

97
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:45,504
where you curl the
fingers of your right hand

98
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:47,536
around the direction of rotation here,

99
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:50,708
you would expect vectors that
point up in the Z direction,

100
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,024
the positive Z direction,
and if I do that,

101
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,540
if I show what all of the
rotation vectors look like,

102
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,888
you'll get this, and maybe
this is kind of a mess

103
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:01,560
because there's a lot of things
on the screen at this point.

104
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,144
So for the moment I'll kind of

105
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:05,566
remove that original
vector field and remove

106
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:07,688
the XY plane, and just
kind of focus on this

107
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,875
new vector field that
I have pictured here.

108
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,500
Inside that column where we
have that tornado rotation

109
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,224
I was describing, all of the vectors

110
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:17,464
point in the positive Z direction,

111
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:19,314
but if we were to view it elsewhere,

112
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:20,504
like over in this region,

113
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,560
those are pointing in
the negative Z direction,

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,581
and if you stick your
thumb in the direction

115
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:26,719
of all of these vectors in
the negative Z direction,

116
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:30,570
that tells you the direction
of, that tells you how

117
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,526
the fluid, maybe you're
thinking of it as air

118
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:33,930
kind of rushing about the room,

119
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,166
how that fluid rotates
it in three dimensions.

120
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,993
So what curl is gonna
do, here I'll kind of

121
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:41,581
clear things up, I have
the formula from last time,

122
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,069
that hopefully hasn't looked too

123
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,621
in the way while I've been doing this,

124
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:47,525
that described curl for a
two dimensional vector field

125
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:50,165
if we imagine that's
not just taking X and Y

126
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,005
as its inputs because it's a
three dimensional vector field,

127
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:56,577
but if we imagine it taking X, Y and Z,

128
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:59,442
so it's a proper three
dimensional vector field,

129
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:02,107
the output is gonna tell
you at every point in space

130
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:06,807
what the rotation that
corresponds to that point is.

131
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,176
And in the next video I'm
gonna give you the formula

132
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,472
and tell you how you
actually compute this curl

133
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:13,143
given an arbitrary function,

134
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:15,231
but for right now we're just
getting the visual intuition,

135
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,847
we're just trying to understand

136
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:19,482
what it is that curl
is going to represent.

137
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:21,307
And in this vector field,
this one that was just kind of

138
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:24,095
copies of a 2D put above,
it's almost contrived

139
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,026
because all of the rotation
happens in these perfect

140
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,558
tornado-like patters that
doesn't really change

141
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:32,413
as you move up and down
in the XY direction,

142
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:34,469
but more generally you might
have a more complicated

143
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:36,026
looking vector field, so I'll go ahead and

144
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:39,338
finally erase this since it's
been a little bit in the way

145
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,171
for a while, and erase this guy too,

146
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,690
and if you think about just arbitrary

147
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,034
three dimensional vector
fields, like let's say

148
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:49,906
this one that I have here,
so I don't know about you,

149
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:53,226
but for me it's really hard
to think about the fluid flow

150
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:55,741
associated with this, I have
a vague notion in my mind

151
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:58,322
that okay, like fluid is
flowing out from this corner

152
00:05:58,322 --> 00:05:59,769
and kind of flowing in here,

153
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,857
but it's very hard to
think about it all at once,

154
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:04,017
and certainly if you start
talking about rotation,

155
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:05,617
it's hard to look at
a given point and say,

156
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:07,721
oh yeah there's gonna be
a general fluid rotation

157
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:10,601
in some certain way and I can
give you the vector for that.

158
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:14,337
But as a more loose and
vague idea, I can say,

159
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:16,941
okay, given that there's
some kind of crazy

160
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,567
air current fluid flow
happening around here,

161
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,761
I can maybe understand
that at a specific point,

162
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:23,545
you're gonna have some kind of rotation,

163
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:25,582
and here I'll picture it
as if there's like a ball

164
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:28,135
or a globe sitting there
in space, and maybe you're

165
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:30,517
imagining your new vector field and saying

166
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:32,482
what kind of rotation is it kind of induce

167
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,669
in that ball that's just
floating there in space?

168
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:37,178
Maybe you're imagining this
as like a tennis ball that

169
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:39,785
you're sort of holding in
place in space using magnets

170
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:42,593
or magic or something like that,
and you're letting the wind

171
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:44,694
sort of freely rotate
it, and you're wondering

172
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:46,953
what direction it tends to rotate,

173
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:49,082
and then when it does and
when you have this rotation,

174
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:52,533
you can describe that 3D rotation
with some kind of vector,

175
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:55,041
and in this case it would
be a vector that points out

176
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,345
in that direction because we're
kind of curling our fingers,

177
00:06:57,345 --> 00:07:00,105
curling our right hand fingers
over in that direction,

178
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:03,281
and if you don't understand
how we describe 3D rotation

179
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:06,033
with a vector, I have a
video on that, maybe go back

180
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,436
and check out that video,
but the idea here is that

181
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:10,760
when you have some sort
of crazy fluid flow

182
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,752
that's induced by some
sort of vector field,

183
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:14,923
and you do this at every point and say,

184
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:16,584
hey what's the rotation
at every single point,

185
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:19,094
that's gonna give you the
curl, that is what the curl

186
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:23,120
of a three dimensional vector
field is trying to represent.

187
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,890
And if this feels confusing,
if this feels like something

188
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,746
that's hard to wrap your
mind around, don't worry

189
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:31,422
we've been there, 3D curl is
one of the most complicated

190
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:34,315
things in multivariable calculus
that we have to describe.

191
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:37,238
But I think the key to
understanding it is to just kind of

192
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:40,479
patiently think through and
take the time to think about

193
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,402
what 2D curl is instead of
thinking about how you extend

194
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:45,678
that to three dimensions
and slowly say, okay, okay,

195
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:47,807
I kind of get it, tornados of rotation,

196
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:49,590
that sort of makes sense,
and if you understand

197
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,614
how to represent three
dimensional rotation around

198
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:54,949
a single point with a
vector, then understanding

199
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,055
three dimensional curl
comes down to thinking about

200
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:58,943
doing that at every single point in space

201
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,750
according to whatever rotation

202
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,654
the wind flow around
that point would induce.

203
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:05,918
Like I said, it is complicated,
and it's okay if it

204
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,314
doesn't sink the first
time, it certainly took me

205
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:12,698
awhile to really wrap my head
around this 3D curl idea,

206
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:15,865
and with that I'll see you next video.
