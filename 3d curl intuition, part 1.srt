00:00:00,345 --> 00:00:01,185
- [Voiceover] Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:03,706
So I'm gonna start talking
about three-dimensional curl.

3
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:05,083
And to do that, I'm gonna start off

4
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:07,123
by taking the two-dimensional example

5
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:08,036
that I very first used

6
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:09,889
when I was introducing the intuition.

7
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:11,221
You know I talked about fluid flow

8
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,588
and I animated it here

9
00:00:12,588 --> 00:00:14,205
where with this particular vector field

10
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:16,990
you see a certain counter-clockwise
rotation on the right

11
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,978
and a clockwise rotation on the top.

12
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,361
So I'm gonna take that vector field

13
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:22,998
which hopefully we have a
little bit of an intuition for

14
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:25,639
and I'm gonna plop it into
three-dimensional space

15
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:27,436
on the x-y plane.

16
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,491
So if I just take that whole vector field

17
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:31,416
and I copy it onto the x-y plane

18
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,617
here's how it looks.

19
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:34,767
And the vector spacing might
be a little bit different,

20
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,608
the choice of what
subsample of points to use

21
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,536
in displaying vectors might
be a little bit different

22
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:40,124
but this is the same field,

23
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,148
and it's actually worth writing out

24
00:00:42,148 --> 00:00:44,853
how it's defined in two-dimensions.

25
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:47,119
This guy is a function of x and y,

26
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,503
so it's a vector field function of x and y

27
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:53,387
and what it's components are.

28
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,554
Now the first component
is y cubed minus nine y

29
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:03,005
and then the next one
is x cubed minus nine x.

30
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:06,545
So now if I look at this guy

31
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:07,770
and I say let's start thinking about

32
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,890
the fluid rotation associated with it,

33
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,597
because it's in three-dimensions

34
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:13,599
it's natural to describe that rotation,

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,493
not just with a number at each point,

36
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:16,956
you know with a scale or value

37
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:18,677
like the two-dimensional curl gives us,

38
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:21,241
but instead to assign
a vector to each one.

39
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,131
And when you do that,

40
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:24,611
when you associate a
vector to each different

41
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:26,682
point in space according
to the fluid rotation

42
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:28,034
that would be happening there,

43
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:30,347
you get something that looks like this.

44
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:31,421
Now this is kind of complicated

45
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:33,621
because there's two different
vector fields going on.

46
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:34,603
One of them, all the vectors

47
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:36,474
are perpendicular to the x-y plane.

48
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:37,988
So let's just kind of
take it piece by piece

49
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:39,803
and see if we can understand it.

50
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:43,412
So I've got four different
circled regions here

51
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:45,012
and one of them is this one on the right

52
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:47,674
where there's counter-clockwise
rotation happening.

53
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,605
And if you think to your right hand rule,

54
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:50,438
I'm gonna go ahead and bring in

55
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:52,426
the picture of the right hand rule here,

56
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:54,437
where you imagine curling your fingers

57
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:56,675
around that direction of rotation,

58
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:58,182
in the fingers of your right hand,

59
00:01:58,182 --> 00:01:59,666
then you stick out your thumb,

60
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,505
the direction your thumb is pointing

61
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:03,068
would be the direction of vectors

62
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:05,364
that describe that rotation.

63
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:08,324
So if we do that here and if we

64
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:10,209
you know, you imagine curling
your right fingers around

65
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,637
there and sticking up your thumb

66
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:12,839
you're gonna get vectors that point

67
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,691
in the positive z-direction.

68
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:16,755
So this is why in that
region you have vectors

69
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:19,206
pointing up, positively
in the z-direction,

70
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,959
they're telling you that
as you view this x-y plane

71
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,466
from above there's
counter-clockwise rotation.

72
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:27,480
But then what about at a different point?

73
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,571
What about up here at the top

74
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:30,133
where you have clockwise rotation?

75
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,230
Now there, if you imagine

76
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,170
taking the fingers of your right hand

77
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,061
and curling them around
that direction of rotation

78
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:38,019
your thumb is gonna be
pointing straight down.

79
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:40,103
It'll be kind of in the
negative z-direction,

80
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:42,679
and we see that with
this vector field here.

81
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,797
Where below that circle, below that point,

82
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,567
you have vectors pointing
straight down indicating that

83
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,398
that's the direction of
rotation in that region.

84
00:02:50,398 --> 00:02:51,713
So if you do this at every single point

85
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,121
and you kind of get an understanding

86
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,521
of what the rotation is at every point

87
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:55,484
and assign a vector

88
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,355
this is the field that you're gonna get.

89
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:58,639
And let's go ahead and describe that

90
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,841
with an actual, with a function.

91
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:03,354
Because we know how to compute
the two-D curl at this point.

92
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:04,917
You see if this whole thing,

93
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:08,288
if we give names to the two
different component functions

94
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,788
as P and Q

95
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:14,667
then the curl, the two-D curl of this guy,

96
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,583
two-D curl

97
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:21,073
of the vector field v

98
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:23,406
has a function of x and y

99
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:26,768
what it equals is the partial derivative

100
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:29,582
of that second component
with respect to x.

101
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:33,833
So the partial of q with respect to x

102
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,194
minus the partial derivative
of that first component

103
00:03:36,194 --> 00:03:37,642
with respect to y.

104
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:42,387
So minus partial of p with respect to y.

105
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:44,200
And what we get when we do that,

106
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,640
the partial of q with respect to x

107
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,200
So we take the partial derivative of this

108
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,171
with respect to x,

109
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:50,453
that just looks like a derivative

110
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:52,278
since there's only x's in there,

111
00:03:52,278 --> 00:03:55,778
and you get three x squared minus nine.

112
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:58,789
And I actually did this,

113
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:01,110
there's another video where
this is the example that I do,

114
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,100
when you take this second
derivative of p with respect to y,

115
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,681
you're taking the
derivative of this top part

116
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,262
with respect to y

117
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:12,429
and that's three y squared minus nine.

118
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:14,372
And what you can do is you can say,

119
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:16,218
this minus nine cancels out with that,

120
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:17,720
you know minus minus nine.

121
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,689
So these guys cancel,

122
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:22,621
and what you ultimately get is

123
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:27,314
three x squared plus three y squared.

124
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:28,946
Now what does this mean
for the vector field

125
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:29,779
that we see here?

126
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,938
Because this, this is a
scale of valued quantity

127
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,270
and yet the vector field that I'm showing,

128
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,719
with all these blue vectors
indicating rotation,

129
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:38,574
these are vectors.

130
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:40,537
And because the rotation is happening

131
00:04:40,537 --> 00:04:42,320
purely in the x-y plane,

132
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,427
which is perpendicular to the z-axis,

133
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:48,219
all of these vectors
purely have a z-component.

134
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:50,304
So what you might say is that the curl,

135
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:51,438
and I'm not gonna say two-D curl,

136
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:54,849
but actual curl of v

137
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:59,050
of v as a function of x and y

138
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,581
is a, it's not a scale or value,

139
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,764
but it's a vector and it's
gonna be a vector that describes

140
00:05:02,764 --> 00:05:05,355
these blue ones in the pure z-direction.

141
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,871
And since they're in the pure z-direction

142
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,568
the x and y components are zero.

143
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:12,113
But that last component is
the formula that we found

144
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:15,810
that describes the magnitude of the curl.

145
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,259
Three x squared minus three y squared,

146
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,909
and this, let's see kinda
running out of room,

147
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:26,098
this here you can think
of as kind of a prototype

148
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:27,407
to three-dimensional curl.

149
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,286
Because really, this vector field v,

150
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,885
is not quite a three-dimensional
vector field is it?

151
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:33,560
It only lives in the x-y plane,

152
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,796
it only take in x and y's input points.

153
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:38,272
So what we wanna do is
start extending this to say,

154
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,287
how can you make this look
like a three-dimensional

155
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:43,721
vector field and still kind
of understand the rotation

156
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,680
as a three-dimensional vector quantity?

157
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,224
And that's what I'm gonna
continue doing in the next video.
