00:00:00,507 --> 00:00:01,653
- [Voiceover] Let's
continue thinking about

2
00:00:01,653 --> 00:00:04,212
partial derivatives of vector fields.

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,101
This is one of those things
that's pretty good practice

4
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:07,512
for some important concepts coming up

5
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:09,574
in multivariable calc,
and it's also just good

6
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:11,759
to sit down and take a complicated thing

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,344
and kind of break it down piece by piece.

8
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:17,030
So a vector field like
the one I just showed

9
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,586
is represented by a
vector-valued function,

10
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,696
and since it's two-dimensional, it'll have

11
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:23,905
some kind of two-dimensional input.

12
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:26,081
And the output will be a vector,

13
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:28,725
each of whose components
is some kind of function

14
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:29,872
of x and y, right?

15
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:33,962
So I'll just write P of
x, y for that x-component

16
00:00:33,962 --> 00:00:36,879
and Q of x, y for that y-component.

17
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:42,437
And each of these are just
scalar-valued functions.

18
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:45,513
It's actually quite common to
use P and Q for these values.

19
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,749
It's one of those things where
sometimes you'll even see

20
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:49,378
a theorem about vector calculus

21
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:50,615
in terms of just P and Q,

22
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,658
kind of leaving it understood
to the reader that,

23
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:55,398
yeah, P and Q always refer
to the x and y components

24
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:57,448
of the output of a vector field.

25
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,985
And in this specific case,
the function that I chose,

26
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:01,842
it's actually the one that
I used in the last video.

27
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:04,486
P is equal to x times y,

28
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:08,403
and Q is equal to y
squared minus x squared.

29
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:11,111
And in the last video,

30
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:13,285
I was talking about interpreting
the partial derivative

31
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,045
of v, the vector-valued function

32
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:17,202
with respect to one of the variables,

33
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,734
which has its merits, and
I think it's a good way

34
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:21,810
to understand vector-valued
functions in general.

35
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,800
But here that's not what I'm gonna do.

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,871
It's actually, another useful skill

37
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:28,852
is to just think in terms
of each specific component.

38
00:01:28,852 --> 00:01:30,249
So if we just think of P and Q,

39
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:33,166
we have four possible partial derivatives

40
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,918
at our disposal here, two
of them with respect to P.

41
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:38,053
So you can think about
the partial derivative

42
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:40,199
of P with respect to x,

43
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,809
or the partial derivative
of P with respect to y.

44
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:45,040
And then similarly, Q,

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,508
you could think about
partial derivative of Q

46
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,008
with respect to x.

47
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:52,793
This should be a partial.

48
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:55,029
Or the partial derivative of Q

49
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:57,295
with respect to y.

50
00:01:57,295 --> 00:01:59,330
So four different values
that you could be looking at

51
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,613
and considering and
understanding how they influence

52
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:03,857
the change of the vector field as a whole.

53
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,075
And in this specific example,

54
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:06,377
let's actually compute these.

55
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,175
So derivative of P with respect to x.

56
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:10,751
P is this first component.

57
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:13,102
We're taking the partial
of this with respect to x.

58
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:14,426
y looks like a constant.

59
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,843
Constant times x.

60
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,594
Derivative is just that constant.

61
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:20,552
If we took the derivative
with respect to y,

62
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:21,575
the roles have reversed,

63
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,148
and its partial derivative is x,

64
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:25,384
'cause x looks like that constant.

65
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:26,989
But Q, its partial derivative

66
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,045
with respect to x, y
looks like a constant,

67
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:33,566
negative x squared goes to negative 2x.

68
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:35,551
But then when you're taking
it with respect to y,

69
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,346
y squared now looks like a function

70
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:39,819
whose derivative is 2y,

71
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:41,640
and negative x squared
looks like the constant.

72
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,771
So these are the four
possible partial derivatives.

73
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:46,862
But let's actually see
if we can understand

74
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,800
how they influence the
function as a whole.

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,411
What it means in terms of the picture

76
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:51,790
that we're looking at up here.

77
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,961
And, in particular,
let's focus on a point,

78
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:55,501
a specific point,

79
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,751
and let's do this one here.

80
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:01,836
So it's something that's
sitting on the x-axis.

81
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,533
So this is where y equals zero

82
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:05,346
and x is something positive.

83
00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:09,734
So this is probably when x
is around two-ish, let's say.

84
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:11,058
So the value we wanna look at

85
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:11,891
is x, y

86
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,996
when x is two

87
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,163
and y is zero.

88
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:20,815
So if we start plugging that in here,

89
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:24,205
what that would mean,
this guy goes to zero,

90
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,232
this guy goes to two,

91
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:28,311
this guy, negative two times x,

92
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:29,972
is gonna be negative two.

93
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:33,163
And then negative two
times y is gonna be zero.

94
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:35,889
And let's start by just looking
at the partial derivative

95
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:38,057
of P with respect to x.

96
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:40,557
So what that means is
that we're looking for

97
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:42,974
how the x-component of
these vectors change

98
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:46,463
as you move in the x direction.

99
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:48,704
For example, around this
point, we're kind of thinking

100
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:50,794
of moving in the x direction, vaguely.

101
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:53,118
So we wanna look at the
two neighboring vectors

102
00:03:53,118 --> 00:03:56,882
and consider what's going
on with the x direction.

103
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:59,189
But these vectors, this
one points purely down.

104
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:00,443
This one also points purely down,

105
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:01,885
and so does this one.

106
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:03,327
So no change is happening

107
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,517
when it comes to the
x-component of these vectors,

108
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:09,616
which makes sense because the
value at that point is zero.

109
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,775
The partial derivative of P
with respect to x is zero,

110
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:12,933
so we wouldn't expect a change.

111
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,766
But on the other hand,

112
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,580
on the other hand, if we're
looking at partial derivative

113
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,497
of P with respect to y,

114
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,696
this should be positive.

115
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:25,134
So this should suggest that
the change in the x-component

116
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:28,717
as you move in the y
direction is positive.

117
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:31,542
So we go up here and now we're not looking

118
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:34,698
at change in the x-direction.

119
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:38,588
Not looking at change in the x-direction.

120
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:39,698
But instead we're wondering what happens

121
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:41,752
as we move generally upwards.

122
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:44,110
So we're gonna kind of
compare it to these two guys.

123
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,473
And in that case, the
x-component of this one

124
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:48,165
is a little bit to the left.

125
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:49,585
The one below it, it's a
little bit to the left.

126
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:52,059
Then we get to our main
guy here and it's zero.

127
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,865
The x-component is zero 'cause
it's pointing purely down.

128
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:56,019
And up here it's pointing
a little bit to the right.

129
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,519
So as y increases,

130
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,695
the x-component of these
vectors also increases.

131
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:03,526
And again, that makes sense

132
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:06,366
because this partial
derivative is positive.

133
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:08,725
This two suggests that
as you're changing y,

134
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,362
the value of p, the
x-component of our function,

135
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,944
should probably keep that on screen.

136
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:16,147
You know, the x-component of
our vector-valued function

137
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:18,802
is increasing 'cause that's positive.

138
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:20,201
For contrast, let's say we look

139
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:22,124
at the Q component over here.

140
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:23,268
So what this is doing,

141
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:24,454
we're looking at changes in the x,

142
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:28,317
and we're wondering what the
y value of the vector does.

143
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:30,190
So we go up here.

144
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,584
And now, we're not looking at
changes in the y direction.

145
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,498
But instead, we're going
back to considering

146
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:37,436
what happens as we change x,

147
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:40,300
as we're kind of moving in
the horizontal direction here.

148
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,481
So again, we look at
these neighboring guys.

149
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:46,227
And now, the y-component
starts off small, but negative,

150
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:47,523
then gets a little bit more negative,

151
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,141
then gets even more negative.

152
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,708
And if we kind of keep looking at these,

153
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,050
the y-component is getting more,
and more, and more negative

154
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,166
so it's decreasing.

155
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,564
The value of Q, the
y-component of these vectors

156
00:05:57,564 --> 00:05:59,290
should be decreasing.

157
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,472
And that lines up 'cause
the partial derivative here

158
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:03,248
was negative two, so that's telling us,

159
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:05,927
given that it started negative,
it's getting more negative.

160
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:07,288
If it started positive, they would've been

161
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:09,212
kind of getting shorter as vectors

162
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:11,473
as their y-component got smaller.

163
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:13,679
And then finally, just to close things off

164
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,560
nice and simply here, if
we look at partial of Q

165
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,060
with respect to y,

166
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:23,865
so now if we start looking at
changes in the y direction,

167
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:26,588
and we start considering
how, as you move below,

168
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:28,081
and then starting to go up,

169
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:29,491
what happens to the y-component,

170
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:32,348
here, the y-component is a
little bit negative, right?

171
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:33,607
It's pointing down and to the left.

172
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:35,368
So down, it's a little bit negative.

173
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:37,982
Here, the y-component is
also a little bit negative.

174
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,433
Over here, well, it remains
a little bit negative.

175
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,487
And you know, from our heuristic look,

176
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,274
there's no discernible change.

177
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:45,314
Maybe it's changing a little bit,

178
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:47,343
and we don't have a fine
enough vision of these vectors

179
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:49,441
to see that, but if we actually go back

180
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:52,843
to the analysis, and see what we computed,

181
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:54,027
in fact, it is zero.

182
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:55,514
That fact that it looked like

183
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:56,675
there was not too much change

184
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:59,141
in the y-component of
each one of these vectors

185
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:01,413
corresponds with the fact
that the partial derivative

186
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:04,107
of that y-component with respect to y,

187
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:07,774
with respect to vertical
movements, is zero.

188
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,290
So this kind of analysis
should give a better feel

189
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,943
for how we understand the
four different possible

190
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:15,859
partial derivatives and what they indicate

191
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:18,159
about the vector field,
and you'll get plenty

192
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:20,228
of chance to practice that understanding

193
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,337
as we learn about divergence and curl,

194
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:24,617
and try to understand
why each one of those

195
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:26,415
represents the thing
that it's supposed to.

196
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:30,440
And you'll see what I mean by
that in just a couple videos.
