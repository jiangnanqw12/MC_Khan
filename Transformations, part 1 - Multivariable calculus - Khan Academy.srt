1
00:00:00,213 --> 00:00:01,413
- [Voiceover] So I have talked a lot

2
00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:03,038
about different ways
that you can visualize

3
00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:04,272
multivariable functions.

4
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:07,083
Functions that will have
some kind of multidimensional

5
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:08,917
input or output.

6
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:10,520
These include three-dimensional graphs,

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,336
which are very common.

8
00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:14,011
Contour maps, vector fields,
parametric functions.

9
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,489
But here, I want to talk about

10
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:16,854
one of my all-time favorite ways

11
00:00:16,854 --> 00:00:19,882
to think about functions,
which is as a transformation.

12
00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:22,366
So any time you have
some sort of function,

13
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,179
if you're thinking very abstractly,

14
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:26,394
I like to think that there's
some sort of input space.

15
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,866
And I'll draw it as a blob, even though,

16
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,235
you know, that could be
the real number line.

17
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:31,028
So it should be a line,

18
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:32,373
or it could be three-dimensional space.

19
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:34,428
And then there's some
kind of output space.

20
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:36,856
And again, I just very vaguely
think about it as this blob.

21
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:40,053
But that could be, again,
the real number line,

22
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:42,069
the x-y plane, a three-dimensional space.

23
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:43,529
And the function is just some way

24
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:45,542
of taking inputs to outputs.

25
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:48,547
And every time that we're
trying to visualize something,

26
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:50,403
like with a graph or a contour map,

27
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:53,367
you're just trying to
associate input-ouput pairs.

28
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:55,573
You know, if f inputs, you know,

29
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:58,889
three gets mapped to the vector one-two.

30
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:00,782
It's a question of how do you associate

31
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:03,174
the number three with that vector one-two.

32
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:04,800
And the thought behind transformations

33
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,095
is that we're just gonna
watch the actual points

34
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:10,943
of the input space move
to the output space.

35
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:12,284
And I'll start with a simple example

36
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:14,668
that's just a one-dimensional function.

37
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:16,416
It will have a single variable input.

38
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,068
And it will have a single variable output.

39
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:23,813
So let's consider the function f of x

40
00:01:25,273 --> 00:01:27,743
is equal to x squared minus three.

41
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,613
And, of course, the way
we're used to visualizing

42
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:33,156
something like this,
it will be as a graph.

43
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:34,863
You might kind of be thinking of something

44
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:36,855
roughly parabolic that's
squished down by three.

45
00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:39,254
But here, I don't want to
think in terms of graphs.

46
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:40,447
I just want to say,

47
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,745
how do the inputs move to those outputs?

48
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:45,621
So as an example, if you go to zero,

49
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,159
when you plug in zero, you're
gonna get negative three.

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,237
You know, zero squared minus three

51
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:51,387
is equal to negative three.

52
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:57,449
So somehow we want to watch
zero move to negative three.

53
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:59,269
And then similarly, let's
say you plug in one,

54
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,886
and you get one squared
minus three is negative two.

55
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:05,744
So somehow we want to watch
one move to negative two.

56
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:09,153
Just another example here.

57
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:11,318
Let's say you are
plugging in three itself.

58
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:16,172
So three squared minus three

59
00:02:16,172 --> 00:02:18,246
is nine minus three is six.

60
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:19,771
So somehow in this transformation,

61
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:23,319
we want to watch three
move to the number six.

62
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:29,456
And with a little animation,
we can watch this happen.

63
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:31,020
We can actually watch what it looks like

64
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,269
for all these numbers to move

65
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:34,451
to their corresponding outputs.

66
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:35,850
So here we go.

67
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,655
Each number will move over

68
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:40,110
and land on its output.

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,792
And I'll clear up the board here.

70
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,415
So I kept track of what the
original input numbers are

71
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,549
by just kind of writing them on top here.

72
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:52,251
And that was a way of just
watching how it moves.

73
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:52,946
And I'll play it again.

74
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:54,701
Here, let's just watch where

75
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:58,507
each number from the input space

76
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:00,134
moves over to the output.

77
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:03,229
And with single variable functions,

78
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:05,127
this is a little bit nice
because it gives the sense

79
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:06,842
of inputs moving to outputs.

80
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:08,509
But where it gets fun is

81
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:10,964
in the context of multivariable functions.

82
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:14,204
So now, let me consider
a function that has

83
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:18,108
a one-dimensional input and
a two-dimensional output.

84
00:03:18,108 --> 00:03:20,891
And specifically, it will be f of x

85
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:25,066
is equal to cosine of x,

86
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,185
cosine of x.

87
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:29,548
And then the y component will be

88
00:03:29,548 --> 00:03:30,887
x sine of y.

89
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:35,208
Sorry, x sine of x.

90
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:41,405
So just to think about a couple examples.

91
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:43,211
If you plug in something like zero,

92
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,995
and think about where zero ought to go,

93
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:49,297
you'd have f of zero

94
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:53,925
is equal to cosine of zero is one.

95
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,702
And then, zero times anything is zero.

96
00:03:57,702 --> 00:03:59,426
So somehow we're gonna watch zero

97
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:01,876
move over to the point one-zero.

98
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,106
And so this is where
we expect zero to land.

99
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:06,315
And let's think about, like, pi.

100
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:08,464
So f of pi.

101
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:16,067
Then cosine of pi is negative one.

102
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:19,697
This is gonna be pi multiplied by,

103
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:21,240
and sine of pi is zero.

104
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,419
So that will again be zero.

105
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,087
So, you know, this little
guy is where zero lands.

106
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,169
And we expect that this is gonna be where

107
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,408
the value pi lands.

108
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:32,657
And if we watch this take place,

109
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:35,207
and we actually watch each
element of the input space

110
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:37,602
move over to the output space,

111
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:38,960
we get something like this.

112
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,441
And again, this is just kind of a nice way

113
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:47,854
to think about what's actually going on.

114
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,089
You might ask questions about whether

115
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:52,936
the space ends up getting
stretched or squished.

116
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:55,548
And notice that this is
also what a parametric plot

117
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:56,696
of this function would look like.

118
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,275
If you interpret it as
a parametric function,

119
00:04:58,275 --> 00:04:59,799
this is what you get in the end.

120
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,257
But whereas in parametrics plots,

121
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:03,690
you lose input information,

122
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,721
here you can kind of see where things move

123
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:08,045
as you go from one to the other.

124
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:09,118
And in the next video,

125
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:11,190
I'm gonna talk about how
you can interpret functions

126
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,668
with a two-dimensional input

127
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:13,986
and a two-dimensional output

128
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:15,591
as a transformation.
