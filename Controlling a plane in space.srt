00:00:00,865 --> 00:00:01,706
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,706 --> 00:00:03,524
So I'm talking about how
to find the tangent plane

3
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:04,457
to a graph.

4
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:05,290
And I think the first step
of that is to just figure

5
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,189
out how we control planes
in three dimensions

6
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:10,224
in the first place.

7
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:13,071
So what I have pictured here
is a red dot representing

8
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:15,102
a point in three dimensions,

9
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,735
and the coordinates of that point,

10
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:18,152
easily enough are

11
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:21,866
one two three.

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,549
So the x coordinate is
one, the y coordinate's two

13
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:26,293
and the z coordinate is three.

14
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,285
And then I have a plane
that passes through it.

15
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:29,831
And the goal of the video is going to be

16
00:00:29,831 --> 00:00:31,051
to find a function,

17
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:32,715
a function that I'll call l,

18
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:35,868
that takes in a two dimensional input

19
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:37,051
x and y

20
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:41,768
and this function l should
have this plane as it's graph.

21
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:42,825
Now the first thing to notice

22
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,289
is that there's lots of different planes

23
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:45,879
that could be passing
through this point, right?

24
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,996
At the moment it's one that's
got a certain kind of angle,

25
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:50,394
you could think of it
going up in one direction,

26
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:52,098
but you could give this a
lot of different directions,

27
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:53,678
and get a lot of different planes,

28
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,629
that all pass through that one point.

29
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:56,767
So we're going to need to find

30
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,109
some way of distinguishing

31
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,858
the specific one that we're looking at,

32
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:01,366
which is this one right here,

33
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,726
from other possible planes
that can pass through it.

34
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:05,661
And as we work through you'll see

35
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:08,603
how this is done in terms
of partial derivatives.

36
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:10,351
But as we are getting our head around

37
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:12,503
what the formula for this graph can be,

38
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:14,373
let's just start observing properties

39
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:15,386
that it has.

40
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:16,566
The first property

41
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:18,679
is that the graph actually
passes through this point,

42
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:19,817
one, two, three.

43
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:22,825
And what that means in terms
of functions over here,

44
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:26,683
is that if you evaluated
at the point one two,

45
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:29,163
the input pair where both
x is one and y is two,

46
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:31,560
then it should equal three.

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,839
It should equal three
because that's telling you

48
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:37,249
that when you go x equals
one and y equals two

49
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:39,362
and then you say what's
the height of the graph

50
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:40,195
above that point,

51
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:41,764
it should be the z coordinate

52
00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:43,186
at the end of the desired point.

53
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,057
So this right here is the fact number one,

54
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:46,559
that we can take into consideration.

55
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:47,494
And beyond that,

56
00:01:47,494 --> 00:01:49,889
let's start thinking
about what makes planes,

57
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,516
what makes these kind of flat graphs,

58
00:01:51,516 --> 00:01:52,980
different from the sort of curvy graphs

59
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,721
that you might be used to in
other multi-variable function.

60
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:58,065
The main idea is that if you intersect

61
00:01:58,065 --> 00:01:59,406
it with another plane,

62
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:00,992
so here I'm going to intersect it with

63
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:04,283
y equals two, this kind of constant plane,

64
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:06,808
and so I'll go ahead and write that down.

65
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:07,948
That plane that you're looking at,

66
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:09,281
is y equals two.

67
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,017
And you can think of this as representing,

68
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:14,538
what is movement in the
x direction look like.

69
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:16,441
As we move along the x direction,

70
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:17,904
this kind of has a slope.

71
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,955
The two planes intersect along a line,

72
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:22,825
and that's one of the
crucial features of a plane,

73
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:24,735
is that if you intersect
it with another plane,

74
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:26,482
you just get a straight line,

75
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:28,109
meaning the slope is constant,

76
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:29,815
as you move in the x direction.

77
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,398
But it's also constant, that same slope,

78
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:32,415
if you move in the y direction.

79
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:33,799
If I had chosen a different plane.

80
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:36,810
If instead I had chosen y equals one,

81
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,045
which looks like this,

82
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:41,275
then you get a line with the same slope.

83
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:43,788
And no matter what constant
value of y you choose,

84
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,699
it's always intersecting that plane,

85
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,506
with a line that has the same slope.

86
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:49,400
And now if you look back

87
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,305
to the videos on partial derivatives,

88
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,160
and in particular

89
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,251
on how you interpret the partial
derivative of a function,

90
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:56,835
with respect to it's graph,

91
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:59,032
what this is telling
you is that when we take

92
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:02,933
the partial derivative
of l with respect to x,

93
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,427
because constant y means you
are moving in the x direction,

94
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:08,133
this should just be some kind of constant.

95
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,754
Some kind of constant a.

96
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:13,921
I'll kind of emphasize that
that is a constant value here.

97
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,785
And the same goes in the
other direction, right.

98
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:18,533
Let's say instead of intersecting it with

99
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,875
constant values of y,

100
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,663
we say well what if
you intersected it with

101
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:24,507
a constant value of x, like x equals one.

102
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:25,970
Well in that case what you should get,

103
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,189
'cos you're intersecting it with a plane,

104
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,101
is another straight line,

105
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:31,425
so these two planes are
intersecting along a straight line,

106
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:33,582
which means as you move
in the y direction,

107
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:35,537
this slope won't change.

108
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:37,245
But also as you move in the x direction,

109
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:38,789
if you imaginee slicing it with
a bunch of different planes,

110
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:42,298
all representing different
constant values of x,

111
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:45,214
you would be getting a
line with that same slope.

112
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:47,048
And that's telling you
another powerful fact.

113
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:49,079
The partial derivative
of l, with respect to y,

114
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,704
now if you're moving in the y direction,

115
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:52,004
that's equal to some other constant,

116
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:53,589
that I'm going to call b.

117
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:54,686
And now, keep in mind,

118
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:56,387
these are very powerful statements,

119
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:58,661
because the partial derivative
of l with respect to x

120
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:00,205
is a function,

121
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:01,665
this is a function of x and y,

122
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:03,860
and that might actually
be worth emphasizing here,

123
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,935
that the partial derivative
of x with respect to y

124
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:08,980
is something that you evaluate at

125
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,156
a point in two dimensional space.

126
00:04:12,156 --> 00:04:13,738
And we're saying that
that's equal to some kind

127
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:14,958
of constant value.

128
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,177
Now that's a pretty powerful thing right?

129
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:18,048
Because it's telling you,
it's giving you control over

130
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:20,080
the function at all possible input points,

131
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,556
for movement in a specified direction.

132
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:23,694
And the same goes over here.

133
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:26,051
This is telling you that. A
function is constantly equal

134
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:30,218
to some value b, and we're
not sure what this value b is.

135
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:33,356
But just geometrically

136
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,492
we can estimate what
these things should be.

137
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:36,999
So if I take back the plane representing

138
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,761
a constant y value, and
we say what's the slope,

139
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:42,197
you're moving in the x direction,

140
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:43,703
we've got a constant y value,

141
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:46,817
what is the slope at which this
plane intersects our graph?

142
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:49,353
I would estimate this as
about the slope of two.

143
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:52,075
You know you go over
one and it goes up two.

144
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,334
So what that would tell you is that,

145
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,445
at least in the specific
graph we're looking at,

146
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:58,621
this is at least
approximately equal to two.

147
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:02,524
And then similarly if we
look at constant x value,

148
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:06,419
and we say that represents
movement in the y direction,

149
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,573
what is the slope there.

150
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:10,646
This looks to me like about one,

151
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:11,498
as a slope.

152
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:13,533
You kind of move over one
unit you go up one unit.

153
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,931
So I'd say down here
that the constant value

154
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:18,328
of the partial derivative
with respect to y

155
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:20,198
is about equal to one.

156
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:22,030
So we have three different facts here,

157
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,161
the value of the function
at the point of one two,

158
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:28,415
the value of its partial
derivative with respect to x

159
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:29,472
everywhere,

160
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:32,317
and the partial derivative
with respect to y, everywhere.

161
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:34,148
And this information
is actually going to be

162
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:37,293
enough to tell us what the
function as a whole should equal.

163
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:40,846
Now specifically, this idea
that the partial derivative

164
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:42,563
with respect to x is constant,

165
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:45,396
tells us that the function l of xy

166
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:48,175
is going to equal

167
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:51,873
two times x plus something that
doesn't have any x's in it,

168
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:54,427
something that as far as x
is concerned is constant,

169
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:57,028
because the only thing whose
derivative, with respect to x,

170
00:05:57,028 --> 00:06:00,573
is the constant two is two x
plus something that's constant,

171
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,432
as far as x is concerned.

172
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:04,098
And then similarly over here,

173
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:07,309
if the partial with respect
to y is the constant one,

174
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:10,722
then that tells you that the
whole function looks like

175
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:13,403
this looks like a constant
as far as y is concerned.

176
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:17,570
So once we bring in y, it's
going to be one times y

177
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,857
plus something that's constant,
as far as y is concerned.

178
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:23,238
You know this part is already constant,

179
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:24,538
as far as y is concerned,

180
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:27,423
so anything that I add beyond
here has to be constant

181
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:29,538
as far as both x and y is concerned.

182
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:32,218
So that part has to actually
literally be a constant.

183
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:35,672
So I'm just going to put in c for that,

184
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:38,271
to represent constant.

185
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,816
So, you can see this is a very

186
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,324
restricted property on our function,

187
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:42,947
because the only place x can show up

188
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:45,381
is this linear term and the
only place y can show up

189
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:47,415
is as this linear term.

190
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:48,797
And when I use the word linear,

191
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:52,169
you can pretty much interpret
as saying the term x shows up

192
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,404
without an exponent or without
anything fancy happening

193
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:55,237
to it.

194
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:56,599
It's just x times a constant,

195
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,179
that's pretty much what I mean by linear.

196
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:00,537
It's got more precise
formulations in other contexts,

197
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:02,125
but as far as we're concerned here,

198
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,386
you can just think of it as meaning

199
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:05,744
variable times a constant.

200
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:08,350
So the question is what should this c be.

201
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,901
And you can imagine that we can,

202
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:10,958
based on this property,

203
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,703
based on the value at the point one two,

204
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:14,936
we can uniquely determine c.

205
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:17,738
And you can plug in, x
equals one, y equals two,

206
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:21,390
know that this has to equal
three and solve for c.

207
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,378
Which we could do but
I'm going to actually

208
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:25,043
do something a little bit more convenient.

209
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:27,238
I'm going to kind of shift around where

210
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,456
the constants show up,
and I'm going to say

211
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,529
that the whole function should equal

212
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,929
two times and then I'm
going to put a constant

213
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:33,783
in with the x,

214
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:36,995
I'm going to say x minus one,

215
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:38,544
and then I'm going to do
the same thing with y,

216
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:40,128
and I'm going to say plus one,

217
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:43,423
here is the partial
derivative with respect to y,

218
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:46,759
y minus and then I'm going to say two.

219
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,102
And the reason I'm doing this,

220
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:49,525
notice this doesn't change

221
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:50,948
the partial derivative information,

222
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,822
it's just if we take
the partial derivative

223
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:55,145
with respect to x, this will still be two,

224
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:56,570
and when we take it with respect to y,

225
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,034
this will still be one.

226
00:07:58,034 --> 00:07:59,617
But the reason I'm putting these in here,

227
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:03,518
is because we're gonna evaluate
it at the point one two

228
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:05,186
so I want to make it
look as easy as possible

229
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:07,703
to evaluate at the point one two.

230
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:09,291
And then from here I'm
just going to add another

231
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,693
constant, so instead of saying c

232
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:13,642
because this is going to be
slightly different from c,

233
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:14,781
I'll call it k.

234
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:16,527
But the idea is that I'm
just moving around constants.

235
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:19,250
If you imagined distributing
the multiplication here,

236
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,606
and having two times that negative one,

237
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:23,396
and one times that negative two,

238
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:25,102
you're just changing what
the value of the constant

239
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,567
stuck on the end here is.

240
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:27,749
Now the important part,

241
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,495
the reason that I'm writing it this way,

242
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:30,919
which is only slightly different,

243
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,380
is because then when I evaluate this,

244
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,837
at l of one two, this whole first part,

245
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:40,602
cancels out because
plugging in x equals one

246
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:42,717
means this whole part goes to zero.

247
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:43,896
Same with the second part,

248
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:45,242
because when I plug in y equals two,

249
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:46,624
this part goes to zero.

250
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:49,712
So k this other constant,
that I'm tagging on the end,

251
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:52,313
is going to completely
specify what happens

252
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:53,856
when I evaluate this at the point one two.

253
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:56,055
And of course I want it to be the case,

254
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:58,664
when I evaluate at one two I get three.

255
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,533
I want it to be the case
when I evaluate at one two,

256
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,961
I get three.

257
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:04,902
So that tells me, that this constant

258
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:07,159
k here should just equal 3.

259
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,843
So notice the way that I've
written the function here,

260
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:10,778
is actually quite powerful.

261
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:11,955
We have a lot of control.

262
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:14,842
This term two was telling us the slope

263
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:16,264
with respect to x.

264
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,421
So when you moved purely
in the x direction,

265
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:20,044
and that was kind of illustrated here,

266
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:21,264
purely in the x direction,

267
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,541
that's telling us the
slope with respect to x,

268
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,082
and then this term one here,

269
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,477
was telling us the
slope with respect to y.

270
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:29,630
So when we moved purely
in the y direction,

271
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,135
that's telling us the slope there.

272
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,926
And we could just turn those knobs if we

273
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:34,833
change the two and we change the one,

274
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,583
that's what's going to allow us to

275
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,920
basically change what the
slopes of the plane are.

276
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,180
I'm going to say slopes plural

277
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,823
because it's with respect to
the x and the y direction.

278
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:46,103
And that will give us control
of various different planes

279
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:46,956
that pass through.

280
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:50,327
If I'm looking at the one right here,

281
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:54,230
then the movement in the y
direction is very shallow,

282
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,142
so that would be turning this knob lower,

283
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,503
and instead of one it
might be point zero one.

284
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:00,662
And if I were looking at
movement in the x direction,

285
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:02,165
you know this looks actually negative.

286
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:03,794
So this would tell you
that it's going to be

287
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:05,054
some kind of negative number.

288
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:06,922
So you can kind of dial
these knobs and that changes

289
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:10,053
the different planes that
pass through that same point.

290
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:13,141
And then, plugging in
this one two and three,

291
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:14,807
tells us what point we're specifying.

292
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,082
We're basically saying when
you input x equals one,

293
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:18,629
and you input y equals 2,

294
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,340
the whole thing should equal three.

295
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,497
So this form right here's
is powerful enough that

296
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,258
I want you to remember
it for the next video.

297
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,847
I want you to remember the
idea of writing things down

298
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:28,636
in this way where you specify

299
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:29,816
the point its passing through

300
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:32,787
with it's x coordinate y
coordinate and z coordinate,

301
00:10:32,787 --> 00:10:33,683
placed where they are,

302
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:36,363
and then you tweak the slopes,
using these coefficients

303
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:37,802
out front.

304
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:39,264
So with that, I will see you next video.
