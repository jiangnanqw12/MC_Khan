1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,200
- [Voiceover] So let's do
another curvature example.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,380
This time, I'll just take
a two-dimensional curve,

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,547
so it'll have two different
components, x of t and y of t

4
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:14,994
and the specific components here will be

5
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,574
t minus the sine of t,

6
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:21,684
t minus sine of t,

7
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:24,267
and then one minus cosine of t.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,000
One minus cosine of t.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,780
This is actually the curve,

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,680
if you watched the very
first video that I did

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,797
about curvature introducing
it, this is that curve.

12
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:35,618
This is the curve that I said,

13
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,078
"Imagine that it's a
road and you're driving

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,678
"along it, and if your
steering wheel gets stuck,

15
00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:41,318
"you're thinking of the
circle that you trace out

16
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:44,318
"as a result and it
various different points

17
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:46,498
"you're gonna be turning it
various different amounts,"

18
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:50,118
so the circle that your
car ends up tracing out

19
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:51,758
would be of varying sizes.

20
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:54,198
So if the curvature's high,
if you're steering a lot,

21
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:56,708
radius of curvature is
low and things like that.

22
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,657
So here, let's actually compute it.

23
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:01,858
And in the last example I walked through

24
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:04,926
thinking in terms of the derivative

25
00:01:04,926 --> 00:01:07,798
of the unit-tangent vector
with respect to arc length

26
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:09,638
but in this case, instead of doing that,

27
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:11,538
I just want to show what it looks like

28
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,658
when we take the explicit
formula that looks like

29
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,638
x prime times y double-prime,

30
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:21,978
minus y prime times x double-prime,

31
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:24,561
and then all of that divided by

32
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,202
x prime squared plus y prime squared.

33
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,819
And then I'm writing x
prime and y prime and such

34
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,598
and all of these you should think of as

35
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:34,799
taking in the variable t.

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,159
I'm must being a little
too lazy to write it.

37
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,999
And you take that to
the three-halves power.

38
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,339
So, this was the formula

39
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:44,099
and I'm not a huge fan
of memorizing formulas

40
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:45,639
and then hoping to apply them later.

41
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,339
I really do think the one
thing you should take away

42
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:49,499
from curvature is the idea that

43
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:51,606
it's the derivative of
the unit-tangent vector

44
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:53,039
with respect to arc length

45
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,139
and if you need to, you can just look up

46
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:57,040
a formula like this but
it's worth pointing out

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,820
that it makes some things easier

48
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,320
to compute because
finding the tangent vector

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,356
and everything can be
kind of like reinventing

50
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,019
the wheel when you already
have the results here.

51
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:07,012
So, first thing to do is just find

52
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:09,578
x prime, y double-prime,

53
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,339
y prime and x double prime.

54
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,719
So let's go ahead and write those out.

55
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,519
So the first derivative of x of t

56
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,719
if we go up here that's t minus sine of t.

57
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,302
So its derivative is
one minus cosine of t.

58
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,359
And the derivative of the y component

59
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,879
of one minus cosine t,

60
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,962
y prime of t,

61
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,900
is gonna be, derivative
of cosine is negative sine

62
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,940
so negative derivative of that is sine,

63
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,339
and that one goes to a constant,

64
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:46,560
and then when we take the second
derivatives of those guys,

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,240
so maybe change the color for
the second derivative here,

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,073
x double prime of the,

67
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,819
so now we're taking
the derivative of this,

68
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:55,959
which actually we just did because

69
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,979
by coincidence the first derivative of x

70
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,097
is also the y component

71
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,597
so that also equals sine of t.

72
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,806
And then y double prime is just
the derivative of sine here

73
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,867
so that's just gonna
be cosine, cosine of t.

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,620
So now, when we just
plug those four values

75
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,405
in for kappa, for our
curvature, what we get

76
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:24,738
is x prime was one minus cosine of t,

77
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,614
multiplied by y double
prime is cosine of t.

78
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:33,614
Cosine of t.

79
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:36,900
We subtract off from that y prime,

80
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,249
which is sine of t,

81
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:40,082
sine of t,

82
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,800
multiplied by x double prime.

83
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,960
So x double prime is also sine of t,

84
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,900
so I could just say

85
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,576
sine of t squared,

86
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:53,743
and the whole thing is
divided by x prime squared

87
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,953
so x prime was one minus cosine of t,

88
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,700
minus cosine of t,

89
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,117
squared, plus y prime squared

90
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,300
so y prime was just sine,

91
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,583
so that's just gonna be sine squared of t.

92
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,500
And that whole thing to
the power three halves.

93
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:17,580
And that's your answer, right?

94
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,720
You apply the formula, you get the answer.

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,833
So for example, when I
was drawing this curve

96
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,040
and kind of telling the
computer to draw out

97
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,620
the appropriate circle,
I didn't go through

98
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,521
the entire "find the unit tangent vector,

99
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:31,961
"differentiate it with respect
with arc length" process,

100
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:33,433
even though that's decently easy to do

101
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,687
in the case of things
like circles or helixes

102
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:37,208
but instead I just went to that formula.

103
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,037
I looked it up because I had forgotten

104
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:41,979
and I found the radius
of curvature that way.
