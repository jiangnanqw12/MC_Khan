1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,720
so we've just computed a vector-valued

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,640
partial derivative of a vector-valued

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,080
function but the question is what does

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,480
this mean what does this jumble of

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,400
symbols actually mean in a you know more

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,000
intuitive geometric setting

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,759
and that has everything to do with how

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,320
you visualize the function and with this

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,240
specific function given that the input

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,160
is two-dimensional but the output is

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,160
three-dimensional and the output is more

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,800
dimensions than the input it's nice to

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,640
visualize it as a parametric surface

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,920
and the way that i do that maybe you

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,679
could call this visualizing it as a

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,200
transformation also because what i want

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,320
to do is basically think of the ts plane

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,239
think of

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,239
the ts plane

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,320
where all these input values live and

21
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,480
kind of think of how that's going to map

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
into three-dimensional space

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
but when i do that i'm actually going to

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,160
cheat a little bit rather than having a

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,520
separate plane off there is the ts plane

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,360
i'm going to

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,399
kind of overwrite onto the xy plane

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,199
itself and plop the ts plane down like

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,800
this

30
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,960
and this isn't the full ts plane this is

31
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,680
actually supposed to represent

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,960
just values of t that range from zero up

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,720
to three

34
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,880
so each tick mark on the graph here

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,159
corresponds with a half so this is one

36
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,400
that's two and then up here is three

37
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,280
same with s s also ranges from zero to

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,560
three

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,080
and the reason that i'm plopping it

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,159
inside three dimensional space to start

41
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,320
with kind of overwriting the xy plane

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,640
with the ts plane is just to make the

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,799
animating a little bit easier it's it's

44
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
you could call it laziness

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,479
but the benefit here is

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,240
what we can do is watch each point and

47
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,960
each one of these points you're thinking

48
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,200
of is corresponding to some kind of ts

49
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,200
pair an input point which is just a pair

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
of numbers and we're going to watch each

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
one of those points move to the

52
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,720
corresponding output right the output is

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,000
a three-dimensional value a

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,680
three-dimensional vector or point

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,040
however you want to think about it and

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
what that looks like when we animate

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,799
this actually

58
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,799
is

59
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,719
each one of those points in our square

60
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,600
of ts plane

61
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,360
moves to the corresponding output

62
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,399
and you end up with a certain surface

63
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560
and just to make it a little more

64
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,560
concrete what's actually going on here

65
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
let's focus in on just one point

66
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
and we'll focus in on this point not

67
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
just for the function visualization but

68
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,400
for the partial derivative as well

69
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,599
and the function or the the point rather

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,400
that i care about is going to be at 1 1.

71
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,599
so this point right here represents the

72
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
pair

73
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,000
of ts

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,840
where each one of them is equal to 1

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,599
1 1.

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,599
and you can start by predicting where

77
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,959
you think this is going to get output

78
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,160
and to do that you just plug it into the

79
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,840
function

80
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,160
this is kind of what the visualization

81
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
means is we're plugging this in

82
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,599
and for t and s we're going to plug in

83
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,200
just one and one

84
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,239
so that top part is going to look like 1

85
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,080
squared minus 1 squared which becomes 0.

86
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,640
that middle part is going to be 1 times

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,480
1 which is 1 and then over here we're

88
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,720
going to have 1 times 1 squared which is

89
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,400
1 minus 1 times 1 squared which is again

90
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,560
1 and you can probably see because of

91
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,159
the symmetry there those also cancel out

92
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
you get 0

93
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,360
which means

94
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,599
the output corresponding with this input

95
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,440
should be the vector 0 1 0 a vector

96
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,360
that's of unit length pointing in the y

97
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,360
direction so if we look here you know

98
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,400
this is the x axis this here is the y

99
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,080
axis

100
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,000
so you would think

101
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,599
it should be a vector that looks kind of

102
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,519
like this

103
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,120
unit vector in the y direction and the

104
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,120
point of the surface is what corresponds

105
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,640
to the tip of that vector right this is

106
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,319
how we visualize parametric things you

107
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,920
just think of the tip of the vector as

108
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,440
kind of moving through space and and

109
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,440
drawing out the thing in this case the

110
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,120
thing it's drawing is a surface so if we

111
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,120
watch that animation again and we let

112
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
things play forward

113
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,319
that dot corresponding with the input 1

114
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,239
1

115
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,640
does indeed land at the tip of that

116
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,319
vector so at least for that value you

117
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,080
can see that i'm not lying to you with

118
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,440
the animation

119
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
and in principle you could do that for

120
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,040
every single point right if any given

121
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,879
input point you kind of plug it through

122
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,720
the function and you draw the vector in

123
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,720
three dimensional space as you watch

124
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,840
this animation it'll land at the tip of

125
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,920
that vector

126
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,319
so um now if we want to start thinking

127
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,640
about what the partial derivative means

128
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,560
remember this is this little dt this

129
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,360
partial t is telling you to nudge it in

130
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,959
the t direction so what is movement just

131
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,920
not even nudges but just movement in

132
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,799
general look like in the t direction for

133
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,880
our

134
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,079
uh our little snippet of the ts plane

135
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,160
here

136
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,960
well the the t direction

137
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,880
um

138
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,880
i'm saying is is in this direction here

139
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,960
where you know this this represents one

140
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,919
two three of t values

141
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
and

142
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,160
this line here represents the constant

143
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,080
value for s so this will be s constantly

144
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
equaling one which you can know because

145
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
it's passing through the point one one

146
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,680
and then otherwise you're just letting t

147
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,199
range freely

148
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
and if we watch how this gets

149
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,720
transformed under the you know under the

150
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,639
transformation under the mapping to the

151
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,800
parametric surface

152
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,800
you can get a feel for what varying the

153
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,400
input t does in the output space right

154
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,400
so this whole pink line

155
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,880
is basically telling you what happens if

156
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,960
you let s constantly equal one but you

157
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,160
let the variable t the input t vary

158
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,680
freely

159
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,440
and you get a certain curve in three

160
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,880
dimensional space

161
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,960
and you know if you had a different

162
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,080
constant for s it would be another curve

163
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,080
and maybe you can kind of see on the

164
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,600
grid lines what shape those other curves

165
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,400
would have and they're all in a sense

166
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,880
you know parallelish to this curve

167
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,120
corresponding to s equals one

168
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,880
so if instead of thinking about movement

169
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
of t as a whole you start thinking about

170
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,639
nudges

171
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,919
this whole partial t

172
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,280
um

173
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,520
is something where we're just imagining

174
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,880
a tiny tiny little movement in the t

175
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,560
direction not really that much just a

176
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
tiny little move and you'll you're it's

177
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
like you're recording its value as

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
partial t so maybe if you're being

179
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,000
concrete you'd say partial t would be

180
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,199
something like 0.01 and really it's

181
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,880
going to be a limiting variable that

182
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,560
gets smaller and smaller but i find it's

183
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,240
kind of nice to think about an actual

184
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
value like 1 100

185
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,600
and then if you if you let this whole

186
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,560
thing undergo the transformation we kind

187
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,319
of watch

188
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
watch the input point watch the line

189
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,000
representing t

190
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
um that little nudge that little nudge

191
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
is going to get maybe stretched or

192
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,039
squished and it's going to result in

193
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,800
some kind of vector

194
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,039
pointing along that curve and it'll be

195
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,639
tangent to that curve right the the

196
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,800
vector that tells you how you move just

197
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,919
a tiny tiny little bit it'll be tangent

198
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,720
in some way

199
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
and

200
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,000
that that

201
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
vector that output nudge is what you're

202
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,039
thinking of as your tiny change to the

203
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
output vector that partial v

204
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,800
and when you divide it by the tiny value

205
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
right if your tiny value was 0.01 and

206
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,240
you divide it by that it's going to

207
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,479
become something bigger so the the

208
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,720
actual derivative isn't going to be just

209
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,960
some tiny little nudge that's you know

210
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,280
hardly hardly visible but it's going to

211
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,880
be that that nudge vector scaled

212
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,120
appropriately in this case it would be

213
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,280
divided by 1 100 or multiplied by you

214
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,199
know 100 and it would be something that

215
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,440
remains tangent to the curve but maybe

216
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,080
it's pointing big and the the larger it

217
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,680
is right the the longer it is

218
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,520
that's telling you that as you let t

219
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,840
vary and you're kind of moving along

220
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,680
this pink curve tiny nudges and t

221
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,919
correspond with larger movements right

222
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,919
the ratio of the nudge sizes is bigger

223
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,080
so if you are if you were to have a a

224
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,919
very long partial derivative vector

225
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,039
that's still tangent but really goes out

226
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,639
there that would tell you that as you

227
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,599
vary t you're zipping along super

228
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,240
quickly

229
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,080
um and if we just look at this you know

230
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,440
this particular one that the stemming

231
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,039
off of one you kind of get a feel for

232
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,639
the curve around that point you say okay

233
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,240
okay and that curve you're moving

234
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,919
positively in the x direction right

235
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,680
you're moving to the right um you're

236
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,160
moving positively in the z direction

237
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,720
you're not z sorry the y positively in

238
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,160
the y direction up there

239
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,319
and the z direction is actually negative

240
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,479
isn't it this curve kind of goes down as

241
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,240
far as z is concerned so before even

242
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,479
computing it if i were to tell you that

243
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,160
i'm going to plug in the value 1 1 to

244
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,240
this partial derivative that we that we

245
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,479
computed in the last video you would say

246
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
oh well just looking at the picture you

247
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,759
can kind of tell that the x value is

248
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,919
going to be something positive something

249
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,680
greater than zero the y value is also

250
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,280
going to be something positive and again

251
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,199
that's because you know the movement is

252
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,440
to the right so positive x it's moving

253
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,960
up so positive y but the z value should

254
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,840
actually be a little bit negative right

255
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,000
because

256
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,759
as you look at this curve it's going

257
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,520
down in a sense

258
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,759
and with that being our prediction if

259
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,520
you start plugging in 1 1 to t and s

260
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,560
what you'll see

261
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,720
is that you know two times one is two

262
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,319
s equals one so that's just one and then

263
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,919
over here this this looks like one

264
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,680
squared minus two times one times one so

265
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,960
this will be one minus two that's

266
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,800
negative 1.

267
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,479
so it is in fact that kind of positive

268
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,840
positive negative pattern that you're

269
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,200
seeing and maybe maybe even from this

270
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,880
curve you can get a feel for why the

271
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,719
movement in the x direction is twice as

272
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,399
much as the movement in the y

273
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,560
it's it's moving more to the right than

274
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,080
it is up in the y direction

275
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,240
and again in principle you can imagine

276
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
doing this not just at the point 1 1 but

277
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,440
at any given point maybe any given point

278
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,720
along this curve or any given point

279
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,600
along the surface

280
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,519
and

281
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,360
the corresponding movement the direction

282
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,880
that you know nudges in the t direction

283
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,560
t q will give you some vector in three

284
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,120
dimensional space and that's the

285
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,080
interpretation that is the

286
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,920
uh

287
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,120
the meaning of the partial derivative of

288
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,000
the

289
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,720
vector valued function here um and again

290
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,720
it's it's not the tiny the actual nudge

291
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,880
vector itself right when you nudge the

292
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,040
input and you get just a little smidgen

293
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,720
in the output space here but it's that

294
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,000
divided by the size of the nudge so

295
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,320
that's why you'll get kind of normal

296
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,680
size vectors rather than tiny vectors

297
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,600
and in the next video i'll do kind of

298
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,600
the same thing for what happens when you

299
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,120
nudge in the s direction just to get a

300
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,120
better feel for what's going on in this

301
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,120
example
