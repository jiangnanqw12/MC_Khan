1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:03,919
- [Voiceover] So I've got a
vector field here, v of x y.

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,233
Where the first component of
the output is just x times y,

3
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:10,057
and the second component is
y squared, minus x squared.

4
00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:12,766
And the picture of this
vector field is here.

5
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:15,006
This is what that vector field looks like.

6
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:17,775
And what I'd like to do
is compute and interpret

7
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:19,595
the divergence of v.

8
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:23,762
So, the divergence of v,
as a function of x and y.

9
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:28,815
And in the last couple of
videos I explained that

10
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:31,615
the formula for this, and
hopefully it's more than just

11
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,827
a formula, but something
I have an intuition for,

12
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:36,904
is the partial derivative
of p with respect to x.

13
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,670
By p, I mean that first component.

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,837
So if you're thinking about
this as being p of x y

15
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:46,109
and q of x y.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,582
So I could use any letters
right, and p and q are common.

17
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:53,413
But the upshot is it's
the partial derivative of

18
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:56,250
the first component with
respect to the first variable.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,271
Plus, the partial derivative
of that second component,

20
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,582
with respect to that second variable, y.

21
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:06,157
And as we actually plug
this in and start computing

22
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:09,338
the partial derivative of p
with respect to x of this guy,

23
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:10,571
with respect to x.

24
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,641
X looks like a variable,
y looks like a constant.

25
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:15,558
The derivative is y, that constant.

26
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:19,207
And then the partial derivative
of q, that second component,

27
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:20,629
with respect to y.

28
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:21,957
We look here.

29
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,779
Y squared looks like a
variable and it's derivative

30
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:25,029
is two times y.

31
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,184
And then x just looks like a constant

32
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:29,717
so nothing happens there.

33
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:32,433
So in the whole, the divergence
evidently just depends on

34
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:33,791
the y value.

35
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,624
It's three times y.

36
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:37,708
So what that should mean is
if we look at, for example,

37
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,300
let's say we look our points
for y equals zero, we'd expect

38
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,203
the divergence to be zero.

39
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:45,425
The fluid neither goes towards
nor away from each point.

40
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:48,661
So y equals zero corresponds
with this x axis of points.

41
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:50,946
So to give it a point here,
evidently it's the case

42
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:54,786
that the fluid kind of flowing
in from above is bounced out

43
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:57,139
by how much fluid flows away from it here

44
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:58,092
and wherever you look.

45
00:01:58,092 --> 00:02:00,354
I mean, here its only
flowing in by a little bit,

46
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,947
and I guess it's flowing
out just by that same amount

47
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:04,782
and that all cancels out.

48
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:08,949
Whereas, let's say we take
a look at y equals three.

49
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:13,123
So in this case the
divergence should equal nine.

50
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:15,956
So we'd expect there to be
positive divergence when y

51
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:17,228
is positive.

52
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:20,801
So if we go up, and y is
equal to one, two, three.

53
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:24,735
And if we look at a point
around here, I'm gonna

54
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:26,710
kinda consider the region around it.

55
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,078
You can kinda see how the
vectors leaving it seem

56
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:30,119
to be bigger.

57
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:34,066
So the fluid flowing out of
this region is pretty rapid.

58
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,855
Whereas the fluid flowing
into it is less rapid.

59
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:39,261
So on the whole, in a region
around this point, the fluid

60
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:40,943
I guess is going away.

61
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:43,043
And you look anywhere where y is positive

62
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:45,739
and if you kind of look
around here, the same is true,

63
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,424
where fluid does flow into it, it seems.

64
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:51,965
But the vectors kind of going
out of this region are larger.

65
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:54,399
So you'd expect on the whole
for things to diverge away

66
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,732
from that point.

67
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,927
In contrast, if you look at
something where y is negative,

68
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:03,199
let's say it was y is equal
to negative four, it doesn't

69
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,032
have to be three there.

70
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:06,440
So there would be a
divergence of negative 12.

71
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,832
So you'd expect things to
definitely converging towards

72
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:10,849
your specific points.

73
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:13,972
So you go down to, I guess I
said y equals negative four.

74
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:17,328
But really, I'm thinking of
anything where y is negative.

75
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:19,770
Let's say we take a
look at this point here.

76
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,111
Fluid flowing into it
seems to be according

77
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:22,981
to large vectors.

78
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:24,984
So it's flowing into
it pretty quickly here.

79
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:27,607
But when it's flowing out
of it, it's less large.

80
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,925
It's flowing out of it in a
kind of a lackadaisical way.

81
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:34,125
So, it kinda makes sense,
just looking at the picture

82
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:38,055
the divergence tends to be
negative when y is negative.

83
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:40,037
And what's surprising, What
I wouldn't have been able

84
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:41,805
to tell just looking
at the picture, is that

85
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,587
the divergence only
depends on the y value.

86
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:48,113
But once you compute everything,
it's only dependent on

87
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:49,363
the y value here.

88
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,099
And that as you go kind
of left and right on

89
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,599
the diagram there.

90
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:57,397
As we look left and right, the value of

91
00:03:57,397 --> 00:03:58,585
the divergence doesn't change.

92
00:03:58,585 --> 00:03:59,725
That's kind of surprising.

93
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:01,038
It makes a little bit of sense.

94
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:03,748
You don't see any notable
reason that the divergence here

95
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:05,179
should be any different than here.

96
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:09,346
But, I wouldn't have known that
they were exactly the same.
