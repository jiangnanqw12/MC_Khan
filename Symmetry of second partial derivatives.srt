1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,153
- [Voiceover] So in
the last couple videos,

2
00:00:02,153 --> 00:00:03,557
I talked about partial derivatives

3
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:05,047
of multivariable functions.

4
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:08,125
And here, I want to talk about
second partial derivatives.

5
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,172
So I'm gonna write some kind
of multivariable function.

6
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:11,157
Let's say it's

7
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,880
well, sine of x times y squared.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,414
Sine of x multiplied by y squared.

9
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:20,124
And if you take the partial derivative,

10
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:22,193
you have two options, given
that there's two variables.

11
00:00:22,193 --> 00:00:23,455
You can go one way

12
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:25,804
and say what's the partial derivative?

13
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:29,091
Partial derivative of f with respect to x.

14
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:30,866
And what you do for that,

15
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,339
x looks like a variable

16
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:34,416
as far as this direction is concerned.

17
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,714
Y looks like a constant.

18
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:38,532
So we differentiate this by saying

19
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:41,605
the derivative of sine of x is cosine x.

20
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:44,020
You know, you're differentiating
with respect to x.

21
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,487
And then that looks like it's
multiplied by a constant.

22
00:00:46,487 --> 00:00:49,649
So you just continue
multiplying that by a constant.

23
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,207
But you could also go another direction.

24
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:52,917
You could also say, you know,

25
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,779
what's the partial
derivative with respect to y?

26
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:59,160
And in that case, you're
considering y to be the variable.

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,435
So here it looks at y.

28
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,045
And says y squared looks like a variable.

29
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:03,652
X looks like a constant.

30
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:05,565
Sine of x then just looks
like sine of a constant,

31
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,980
which is a constant.

32
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,449
So that will be that constant, sine of x,

33
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:12,966
multiplied by the derivative of y squared.

34
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,747
Which is gonna be two times y.

35
00:01:15,897 --> 00:01:17,197
Two times y.

36
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,681
And these are what you might call

37
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,855
first partial derivatives.

38
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:24,283
And there's some alternate
notation here, df dy.

39
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:26,665
You could also say f and
then a little subscript y.

40
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:28,221
And over here, similarly,

41
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,595
you'd say f with a little subscript x.

42
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:33,405
Now each of these two functions,

43
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,127
these two partial derivatives that you get

44
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:37,116
are also multivariable functions.

45
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:39,197
They take in two variables
and they output a scalar.

46
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:41,093
So we can do something very similar,

47
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:43,118
where here you might then apply

48
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,316
the partial derivative with respect to x

49
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:49,819
to that partial derivative
of your original function

50
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,150
with respect to x, right.

51
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,569
It's just like a second
derivative in ordinary calculus,

52
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:56,963
but this time we're doing it partial.

53
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:58,611
So when you do it with respect to x,

54
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:01,289
cosine x looks like cosine of a variable.

55
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,267
The derivative of which is negative sine

56
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:06,504
times that variable.

57
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:09,415
And y squared here just
looks like a constant.

58
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:11,648
So it just stays constant at y squared.

59
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:13,820
And, similary, you could go down

60
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,604
a different branch of options here.

61
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:17,698
And say what if you did
your partial derivative

62
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:19,646
with respect to y?

63
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:20,866
Of that whole function,

64
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:24,339
which itself is a partial
derivative with respect to x.

65
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,714
And if you did that,

66
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,551
then y squared now
looks like the variable.

67
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,395
So you're gonna take
the derivative of that,

68
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:34,987
which is two y.

69
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,201
Two y.

70
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:38,402
And then what's in front of
it just looks like a constant

71
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:41,798
as far as the variable y is concerned.

72
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:43,709
So that stays as cosine of x.

73
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,553
And the notation here.

74
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:49,107
First of all, just as in
single-variable calculus,

75
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:52,407
it's common to kind of
do a abusive notation

76
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:53,343
with this kind of thing

77
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:56,238
and write partial squared of f

78
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:01,184
divided by partial x squared.

79
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:03,845
And this always, I don't know.

80
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:05,079
When I first learned about these things,

81
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:05,925
they always threw me off

82
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:07,910
because here, this Leibniz notation,

83
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,547
you have the great intution of, you know,

84
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,013
nudging the x and nudging the f.

85
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:13,267
But you kind of lose
that when you do this.

86
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:15,608
But it makes sense if you think of this

87
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,635
partial, partial x as being an operator

88
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:19,409
and you're just applying it twice.

89
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,073
And over here, the way
that that would look,

90
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,331
it's a little bit funny.

91
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,014
Because you still have that
partial squared f on top.

92
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:26,357
But then on the bottom,

93
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:30,987
you write partial y, partial x.

94
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:32,806
And, you know, I'm putting
them in these order

95
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:35,061
just because it's as if I
wrote it that way, right.

96
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:37,247
This reflects the fact that
first I did the x derivative.

97
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:39,414
Then I did the y derivative.

98
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:41,506
And you could do this on this side also.

99
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:42,842
And this might feel tedious,

100
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:44,607
but it's actually kind of worth doing

101
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,695
for a result that we end up seeing here

102
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:49,795
that I find a little bit
surprising, actually.

103
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:51,885
So here, if we go down the path

104
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:54,717
of doing, in this case,
like a partial derivative

105
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,145
with respect to x.

106
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,244
And, you know, you're thinking of this

107
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:59,715
as being applied to your
original partial derivative

108
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:00,941
with respect to y.

109
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:04,923
It looks here, it says sine
of x looks like a variable.

110
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:06,545
Two y looks like a constant.

111
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:07,923
So what we end up getting

112
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:11,023
is derivative of sine of x, cosine x.

113
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:14,730
Multiplied by that two y.

114
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,251
And a pretty cool thing
worth pointing out here

115
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:23,380
that maybe you take it for granted.

116
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,832
Maybe you think it's as surprising

117
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,148
as I did when I first saw it.

118
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:28,493
Both of these turn out to be equal, right.

119
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:30,002
Even though it was a very different way

120
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:30,813
that we got there, right?

121
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,757
You first take the partial
derivative with respect to x

122
00:04:32,757 --> 00:04:34,423
and you get cosine x, y squared.

123
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:36,920
Which looks very different
from sine x, two y.

124
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,503
And then when you take the derivative

125
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:40,011
with respect to y,

126
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,758
you know, you get a certain value.

127
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:44,582
And when you go down the other path,

128
00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:46,526
you also get that same value.

129
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:48,151
And maybe the way that you write this

130
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:50,139
is that you'd say

131
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,952
Let me just copy this guy over here.

132
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,022
And what you might say is that

133
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,214
the partial derivative of f.

134
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:02,592
When you do it the other way around,

135
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:04,367
when instead of doing x and then y,

136
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:08,329
you do y and then x.

137
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:09,618
Partial x.

138
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:11,390
That these guys are equal to each other.

139
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,252
And that's a pretty cool result.

140
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:15,595
And maybe in this case,

141
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,372
given that the original function

142
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:18,895
just looks like the product of two things,

143
00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:20,776
you can kind of resaon
through why it's the case.

144
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:24,366
But what's surprising is that
this turns out to be true

145
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,092
for, I mean, not all functions.

146
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,155
There's actually a certain criterion.

147
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,589
There's a special theorem,

148
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:31,864
it's called Schwarz's theorem.

149
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:36,145
Where if the second partial derivatives

150
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:38,405
of your function are continuous
at the relevant point,

151
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,289
that's the circumstance
for this being true.

152
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,095
But for all intents and purposes,

153
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:43,975
the kind of functions you
can expect to run into,

154
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:45,464
this is the case.

155
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:48,357
This order of partial
derivatives doesn't matter.

156
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:50,344
Truth turns out to hold.

157
00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:51,866
Which is actually pretty cool.

158
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,424
And I'd encourage you to play around

159
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:54,353
with some other functions.

160
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,168
Just come up with any
multivariable function,

161
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:57,383
maybe a little bit more complicated

162
00:05:57,383 --> 00:06:00,127
than just multiplying two
separate things there,

163
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,669
and see that it's true.

164
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:02,913
And maybe try to convince yourself

165
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:04,394
why it's true in certain cases.

166
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:07,059
I think that ought to actually
be a really good exercise.

167
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:08,481
And just before I go,

168
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:10,169
one thing that I should probably mention,

169
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,116
a bit of notation that
people will commonly use.

170
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:15,757
With the second partial derivative,

171
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:17,485
sometimes instead of saying

172
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:19,793
partial squared f, partial x squared,

173
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:22,894
they'll just write it as
partial and then x, x.

174
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,696
And over here, this would be partial.

175
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:27,597
Let's see, first you
did it with x, then y.

176
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:30,045
So over here you do it first x and then y.

177
00:06:30,045 --> 00:06:31,418
Kind of the order of these reverses.

178
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:32,800
Because you're reading left to right.

179
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,909
But when you do it with this,

180
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,225
you're kind of reading right to left

181
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,479
for how you multiply it in.

182
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,593
Which would mean that this guy,

183
00:06:38,593 --> 00:06:40,349
let's see, this guy over here.

184
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,721
Now he would be partial.

185
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,960
First you did the y,

186
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,211
and then you did the x.

187
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:47,816
So those two guys are
just different notations

188
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:48,896
for the same thing.

189
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:50,666
I mean, that can make it a
little bit more convenient

190
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,320
when you don't want to write out

191
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,932
the entire partial squared f
divided by partial x squared

192
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,684
or things like that.

193
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:01,324
And with that, I'll call it an end.
