1
00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:01,765
- [Voiceover] So, in
the last video I talked

2
00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:04,614
about curvature and the
radius of curvature,

3
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:06,220
and I described it purely geometrically

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,647
where I'm saying, you imagine driving

5
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:10,339
along a certain road,
your steering wheel locks,

6
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,408
and you're wondering what
the radius of the circle

7
00:00:12,408 --> 00:00:14,685
that you draw with your
car, you know through

8
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:16,646
whatever surrounding fields
there are on the road

9
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:19,197
as a result, and the special symbol

10
00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:22,324
that we have for this,
for this idea of curvature

11
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:24,844
is a little kappa, and
that's gonna be one divided

12
00:00:24,844 --> 00:00:26,292
by the radius, and the reason we do

13
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,805
that is basically you want a large kappa,

14
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:31,988
a large curvature to
correspond with a sharp turn

15
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:35,733
so, sharp turn, small
radius, large curvature.

16
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:37,117
But the question is how do we describe

17
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:39,784
this in a more mathematical way?

18
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:45,157
So, I'm gonna to go ahead
and clear up, get rid of the

19
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:47,484
circle itself and all of that radius

20
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:50,947
and just be looking at the
curve itself in it's own right.

21
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:53,029
The way you typically
describe a curve like this

22
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:54,938
is para-metrically, so, you'll have

23
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:56,997
some kind of vector valued function s

24
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:59,565
that takes in a single parameter t,

25
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:02,052
and then it's gonna output
the x and y coordinates,

26
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:04,395
each as functions of t.

27
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:06,716
So, this will be the x coordinate,

28
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:08,133
the y coordinate.

29
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:12,141
And then this specific
case, I'll just tell you

30
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:15,503
the curve that I drew
happens to be parameterized

31
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:19,670
by one minus the sign of t
as the x component function,

32
00:01:21,844 --> 00:01:24,756
actually no, it's t minus
sign of t, and the bottom part

33
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:26,839
is one minus cosign of t.

34
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,276
That's the curve that I drew.

35
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:32,860
And the way that you're
thinking about this

36
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,670
is for each value t you
get a certain vector

37
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,340
that puts you at a point on the curve,

38
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,205
and as t changes the
vector you get changes,

39
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,300
but the tip of that vector kind of traces

40
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,967
out the curve as a whole, right?

41
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,901
And you can imagine the
vector drawing the curve

42
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:52,543
as t varies,

43
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:54,797
and the thought behind making
curvature mathematical,

44
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:57,317
here I'll kind of clear
up some room for myself,

45
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,424
is that you take the tangent vectors here

46
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:01,257
so,

47
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:05,765
so, you might image a unit tangent vector

48
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:07,515
at every given point,

49
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:09,479
and you're wondering

50
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,510
how quickly those guys change direction,

51
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,343
right?

52
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,350
So with the little schematic
that I have drawn here

53
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,783
I'm just gonna call this guy t one

54
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:22,664
for like the first tangent vector,

55
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:26,044
t2 , t3, and I haven't specified

56
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:26,930
where they started or anything

57
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,299
I just what give a feel for you've got

58
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:29,853
various different tangent vectors

59
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:31,739
and I'm just gonna say that all of them

60
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,348
each one of them t sub
somethings has a unit length.

61
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:38,619
And the idea of curvature
is to look at how quickly

62
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:41,346
that unit tangent vector
changes directions.

63
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:44,802
So, you know you might imagine
a completely different space

64
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:47,715
so, rather than rooting
each vector on the curve,

65
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:49,642
let's see what it would look like if you

66
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:50,798
just kind of write each vector

67
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:52,898
in its own right off in some other spot.

68
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:55,700
So, this guy here would be t one,

69
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,194
and then t two points a little bit down,

70
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:03,819
and then t three points
kind of much more down

71
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,347
So, all of these, this would
be t one, that guy is t two

72
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:09,779
and these are the same vectors
I'm just kind of drawing them

73
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:12,234
all rooted at the same spot
so it's a little easier

74
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,138
to see how they turn, and you wanna say,

75
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:16,261
okay how much do you
change as you go from t one

76
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,677
to t two, is that a large angle change?

77
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:20,955
and as you go from t two to t three,

78
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:22,655
is that a large change as well?

79
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:25,712
And you can kind of see
how if you have a curve,

80
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:27,779
and let's say it's,

81
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,606
if you have a curve
that curves quite a bit,

82
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:31,687
you know it's doing something like that

83
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:34,354
then the unit vector,
the unit tangent vector

84
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:37,006
at this point changes quite rapidly

85
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:38,581
over a short distance to be something

86
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:40,143
almost 90 degrees different.

87
00:03:40,143 --> 00:03:42,487
Whereas, if you take the unit vector here

88
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:44,290
and see how much does
it change as you go from

89
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,376
this point over to this point

90
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,383
it doesn't really change that much.

91
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:49,502
So, the thought behind curvatures,

92
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:50,815
we gonna take the rate of change of

93
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,690
that unit tangent vector,

94
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,039
so, the rate of change of t, and I'm gonna

95
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,144
let capital T be a function

96
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:58,952
that tells you whatever
the unit tangent vector

97
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:00,606
at each point is,

98
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:01,930
and I'm not gonna take the rate of change

99
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,465
in terms of, you know
the parameter little t,

100
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:07,744
which is what we use to
parameterize the curve,

101
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:09,886
because it shouldn't matter
how you parameterize the curve,

102
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:12,143
maybe you're driving
along it really quickly

103
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:13,299
or really slowly.

104
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,879
Instead, what you wanna take

105
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,481
is the rate of change with
respect to arc length.

106
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:20,887
Arc length, and I'm
using the variable s here

107
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,391
to denote arc length, and what I mean by

108
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:26,767
that is that if take just
a tiny little step here

109
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,787
the distance of that
step, the actual distance

110
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:32,759
in the x y plane, you
consider to be the arc length.

111
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,367
And if you imagine it
being really, really small

112
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,069
you're considering that a d s,

113
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,581
a tiny change in the arc length.

114
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:40,391
So this is the quantity
that we care about.

115
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:43,511
How much does that unit
tangent vector change

116
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,736
with respect to a tiny
change in the arc length?

117
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:47,631
You know, as we travel along, let's say,

118
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:50,714
it was a distance of like 0.5, right,

119
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:55,576
you wanna know, did this
unit vector change a lot

120
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:56,580
or a little bit.

121
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,583
But I should add something here,

122
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,913
this tiny change in the vector

123
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:01,341
that would tell you,

124
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:02,999
you know what the vector connecting

125
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,887
their two tips is,

126
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,589
so, this would be a
vector valued quantity,

127
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,675
and curvature itself
should just be a number.

128
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,647
So, what we really care about
is the size of this guy.

129
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:14,767
So, what we really care
about, the size of this,

130
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:17,358
which is a vector valued quantity,

131
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,516
and that'll be an indication of just

132
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:20,367
how much the curve curves.

133
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,044
But if I'm at a sharper turned curve

134
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:23,761
you go over that same distance

135
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,216
and then suddenly the change

136
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:27,793
in the tangent vectors goes by quite a bit

137
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:30,535
that would be telling you
it's a high curvature.

138
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:32,110
And in the next video
I'm gonna talk through

139
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,755
what that looks like, how you think about

140
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:36,939
this tangent vector function,

141
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,699
this unit tangent vector function,

142
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,236
and what it looks like to
take the derivative of that

143
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:43,315
with respect to arc length.

144
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:44,795
It can get a little convoluted

145
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:46,452
in terms of the symbols involved,

146
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:47,715
and the constant picture you should have

147
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,011
in the back of your mind is that circle,

148
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:52,093
that circle that's hugging
the curve very closely

149
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:53,867
at a certain point,

150
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:57,356
and this means of taking the
magnitude of the rate of change

151
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,987
of the unit tangent vector
with respect to arc length

152
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:04,320
is all just trying to capture that idea.
