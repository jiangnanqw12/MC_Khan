00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:01,385
- [Voiceover] So in the last video,

2
00:00:01,385 --> 00:00:03,104
I talked about vector
fields in the context

3
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:06,064
of two dimensions, and here,
I'd like to do the same

4
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:07,666
but for three-dimensions.

5
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:09,570
So a three-dimensional vector field

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,902
is given by a function, a
certain multi-variable function

7
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:14,690
that has a three-dimensional input

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,769
given with coordinates x, y and z,

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:19,683
and then a three-dimensional vector output

10
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:21,784
that has expressions that
are somehow dependent

11
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:23,781
on x, y, and z, I'll just
put dots in here for now,

12
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:26,207
but we'll fill this in with
an example in just a moment.

13
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:27,426
And the way that this works,

14
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:29,110
just like with the
two-dimensinal vector field,

15
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,246
you're gonna choose a
sample of various points

16
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:32,941
in three-dimensional space.

17
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:34,411
And for each one of those points,

18
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:36,849
you consider what the
output of the function is

19
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:38,985
and that's gonna be some
three-dimensional vector.

20
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:42,770
And you draw that vector
off of the point itself.

21
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,572
So to start off, let's
take a very simple example,

22
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:50,108
one where the vector that outputs

23
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:52,070
is actually just a constant.

24
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,705
So in this case, I'll make
that constant the vector,

25
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,585
one, zero, zero.

26
00:00:57,585 --> 00:01:00,568
So what this vector is,
it's just got a unit lenth

27
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:03,482
in the x direction, so this is the x axis.

28
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:05,909
So all of the vectors
are gonna end up looking

29
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,785
something like this where it's a vector

30
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:10,722
that has length one in the x direction.

31
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:14,182
And when we do this, at
every possible point,

32
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:15,378
well not every possible point,

33
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:20,006
but a sample of a whole bunch of points,

34
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,692
we get a vector field
that looks like this.

35
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:24,967
At any given point in space,

36
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,349
we get one of these little blue vectors

37
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:27,754
and all of them are the same,

38
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,170
they're just copies of each other,

39
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,895
each pointing with unit
length in the x direction.

40
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:38,307
So as vector fields go,
this is relatively boring,

41
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,967
but we can make it a
little bit more exciting

42
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,392
if we make the input
start to depend somehow

43
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:44,588
on the actual input.

44
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:48,489
So what I'll do to start,
I'll just make the input

45
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:49,952
y, zero, zero.

46
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:51,833
So they're still just gonna
point in the x direction,

47
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,888
but now it's gonna depend on the y value.

48
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:56,872
So let's think of a second
before I change the image,

49
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:58,207
what that's gonna mean.

50
00:01:58,207 --> 00:01:59,867
The y axis is this one here,

51
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,910
so now the z axis is pointing
straight in our face,

52
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,327
that's the y.

53
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:07,228
So as y increases value
to one, two, three,

54
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:09,689
the length of these
vectors are gonna increase,

55
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,547
it's gonna be a stronger
vector in the x direction,

56
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,590
a very strong vector in the x direction.

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,028
And if y is negative, these
vectors are gonna point

58
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:17,456
in the opposite direction.

59
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:21,090
So let's see what that looks like.

60
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,146
Here we go.

61
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:24,817
So in this vector field, color and length

62
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:28,277
are used to indicate the
magnitude of the vector.

63
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:29,890
So red vectors are very long,

64
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,993
blue vectors are pretty short,

65
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:32,189
and at zero, we don't even see any

66
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:35,556
because those are
vectors with zero length.

67
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,588
And just like with two
dimensional vector fields,

68
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:39,596
when you draw them, you lie a little bit.

69
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:41,895
This one should have a
length of one, right?

70
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,532
Because when y is equal to one,

71
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:44,856
this should have a unit length,

72
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:46,307
but it's made really, really small.

73
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:49,267
And this one up here,
where y is five or six,

74
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,951
should be a really long vector,

75
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:52,274
but we're lying a little bit

76
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:54,248
because if we actually drew them to scale,

77
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:56,593
it would really clutter up the image.

78
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,927
So a couple things to
notice about this one,

79
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:02,607
since the output doesn't depend on x or z,

80
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,175
if you move in the x direction,

81
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:05,626
which is back and forth here,

82
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:06,868
the vectors don't change.

83
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:08,192
And if you move in the z direction

84
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:11,013
which is up and down, the
vectors also don't change.

85
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:14,275
They only change as you
move in the y direction.

86
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:16,957
Okay, so we're starting to
get a feel for how the output

87
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:18,432
can depend on the input.

88
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:23,273
Now let's do something
a little bit different.

89
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:24,736
Let's say that all three of the components

90
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:27,789
of the input depend on x, y, and z,

91
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:30,587
but I'm just gonna make it
kind of an identity function.

92
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:32,329
At a given point x, y, z,

93
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:35,336
you output the vector itself, x, y, z.

94
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:37,855
So let's think about what
this would actually mean.

95
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:39,906
And let's say you've got a given point,

96
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:42,553
some point floating off in space.

97
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:44,654
What is the output vector for that?

98
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:46,442
Well the point has a certain x component,

99
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:49,867
a certain y component, and a z component.

100
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:52,665
And the vector that corresponds to x, y, z

101
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:56,787
is gonna be the one from the
origin to that point itself.

102
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:58,726
Let me just draw that here

103
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:01,698
from the origin to the point itself.

104
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:03,486
And because of how we do vector fields,

105
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:06,481
you move this so that instead
of stemming from the origin,

106
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:09,418
it actually stems from the point.

107
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:11,288
But the main thing to take away from here

108
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:14,167
is it's gonna point directly
away from the origin.

109
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,618
And the farther away the point is,

110
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:17,557
the longer this vector will be.

111
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:22,312
So with that, let's take a look
at the vector field itself.

112
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,045
Here we go.

113
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:27,727
So again, you kind of
lie when you draw these.

114
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,247
Like the vectors, these red
guys that are out at the end,

115
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:31,466
they should be really long

116
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,881
'cause this vector should
be as long as that point is

117
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:35,599
away from the origin.

118
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,782
But to give a cleaner vector field,

119
00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:40,522
you scale things down,
and notice the blue ones

120
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:41,779
that are close to the center here,

121
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,290
are actually really, really short guys.

122
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,807
And all of these are pointing
directly away from the origin.

123
00:04:47,807 --> 00:04:48,968
And this is one of those vector fields

124
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:50,106
that is actually pretty,

125
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:52,660
a good one to have a strong intuition of

126
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,879
'cause it comes up now and then,

127
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,720
thinking about what the
identity function looks like

128
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,993
as a vector field itself.

129
00:04:57,993 --> 00:05:00,372
In the next video, I'll
talk through another example

130
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:02,496
that's a little bit more
complicated than this

131
00:05:02,496 --> 00:05:04,516
and can hopefully give
an even stronger feel

132
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:08,702
for how the output can
depend on x, y, and z.
