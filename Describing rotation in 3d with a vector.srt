00:00:01,241 --> 00:00:02,386
- [Voiceover] How do you describe rotation

2
00:00:02,386 --> 00:00:04,076
in three dimensions?

3
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:06,266
So for example, I have here a globe

4
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:07,915
and it's rotating in some way

5
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:09,866
and there's a certain
direction that it's rotating

6
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:11,747
and a speed with which it's rotating.

7
00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:14,277
And the question is how could
you give me some numerical

8
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:17,694
information that perfectly
describes that rotation?

9
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:20,199
So you give me some numbers,
and I can tell you the speed

10
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,871
and the direction and
everything associated

11
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:23,708
with this rotation.

12
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,999
But before talking about that,

13
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:26,654
let's remind ourselves
of how we talked about

14
00:00:26,654 --> 00:00:28,209
two dimensional rotation.

15
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:30,033
So I have here a little pi creature,

16
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:32,510
and I set him to start rotating about

17
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,154
and the way that we can describe this,

18
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:36,833
we pretty much need to
just give a rate to it.

19
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:41,000
And you might give that rate
as a number of rotations

20
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:47,233
per second, some unit of
time. So rotations per second.

21
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:49,943
And in this case, I think
I programmed him so that

22
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:53,194
he's going to do one rotation
for every five seconds.

23
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:56,244
So his rotational rate would be 0.2.

24
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:57,676
But that's a little bit ambiguous

25
00:00:57,676 --> 00:00:59,557
because if you just say,
"Hey, this little pi creature

26
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:02,111
is rotating at 0.2 rotations per second,"

27
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:04,131
someone could say, "Well, is it clockwise

28
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,705
or counterclockwise?"

29
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:06,964
So there's some ambiguity.

30
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:08,473
And the convention that
people have adopted

31
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:10,911
is to say, "Well, if I
give you a positive number,

32
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:13,279
if the number is positive,
then that's going to tell you

33
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:17,268
that the nature of the
rotation is counterclockwise,

34
00:01:17,268 --> 00:01:18,620
but if I give you a negative number,

35
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,896
if instead you see something
that's a negative number

36
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,776
of rotations per second,
that would be rotation

37
00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:25,007
the other way, going clockwise."

38
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:26,910
And that's the convention.

39
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,744
That's just what people have decided on.

40
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:31,524
And with this it's very nice
because given a single number,

41
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,434
just one number, and it could
be positive or negative,

42
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:36,499
you can perfectly describe
two dimensional rotation.

43
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:38,032
And there's a minor nuance here,

44
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,513
usually in physics and
math, we don't actually use

45
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:43,512
rotations per unit second but
instead you describe things

46
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:47,679
in terms of the number of
radians per unit second.

47
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:51,476
And just as a quick
reminder of what that means,

48
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:53,589
if you imagine some kind of circle,

49
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:55,726
and it could be any circle,
the size doesn't really matter,

50
00:01:55,726 --> 00:01:59,076
and if you draw the radius to
that and then ask the question

51
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:01,530
how far along the circumference
would I have to go

52
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,595
such that the arc length,
that sort of sub-portion

53
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:07,452
of the circumference, is
exactly as long as the radius?

54
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:11,003
So if this was R, you'd want
to know how far you have to go

55
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:14,024
before that arc length is also R.

56
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:16,826
And then that, that angle,
that amount of turning

57
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:19,270
that you can do, determines one radian.

58
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,244
And because there's exactly two pi radians

59
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:24,502
for every rotation, to
convert between rotations

60
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:25,912
per unit second and
radians per unit second,

61
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,579
you just multiply this guy by 2π

62
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,279
so it would be whatever the
number you have there times 2π.

63
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,874
And the specific numbers
aren't too important.

64
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:38,247
The main upshot here is
that with a single number,

65
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:40,192
positive or negative, you
can perfectly describe

66
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,026
two dimensional rotation.

67
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:43,811
But if we look over here at the 3D case,

68
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:45,184
there's actually more information

69
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:47,514
than just one number that
we're going to need to know.

70
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:49,745
First of all, you want to know the axis

71
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:52,197
around which it's rotating,
so the line that you can draw

72
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:55,387
such that all rotation
happens around that line.

73
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,351
And then you want to
describe the actual rate

74
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:59,267
at which it's going. You
know, is it slow rotation

75
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:00,254
or is it fast?

76
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:03,743
So you need to know a direction
along with a magnitude.

77
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:06,260
And you might say to yourself,
"Hey, direction? Magnitude?

78
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,981
Sounds like we could use a vector."

79
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:09,333
And in fact, that's what we do.

80
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,755
We use some kind of vector whose length

81
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:14,047
is going to correspond to the
rate at which it's rotating,

82
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:15,741
typically in radians per second,

83
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:17,367
it's called the angular velocity.

84
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:21,999
And then the direction describes
the axis of rotation itself

85
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:24,612
But similar to how in
two dimensions there was

86
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:27,508
an ambiguity between clockwise
and counterclockwise,

87
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,142
if this was the only convention we had,

88
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,252
it would be ambiguous whether
you should use this vector

89
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:35,040
or if you should use one pointing
in the opposite direction.

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,965
And the way I've chosen to
draw these guys, by the way,

91
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:38,311
it doesn't matter where they are,

92
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:40,848
remember a vector it just has
a magnitude and a direction

93
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:42,514
and you can put it anywhere in space.

94
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,745
I figured it was natural enough

95
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,301
to just kind of put them around the poles

96
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:46,508
just so that you could see them

97
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:48,505
on the axis of rotation itself.

98
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:51,082
So the question is,
what vector do you use?

99
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:52,963
Do you use the one
pointing in this direction?

100
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:54,960
Or do you use this green one pointing

101
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,237
in the opposite direction?

102
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,630
And for this, we have a convention

103
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,325
known as the right-hand rule.

104
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:01,048
So I'll go ahead and
bring in a picture here

105
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:03,964
to illustrate the right-hand rule.

106
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:06,005
What you imagine doing
is taking the fingers

107
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:08,271
of your right hand and curling them around

108
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:10,014
in the direction of rotation.

109
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:11,516
And what I mean by that is
the tips of your fingers

110
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,513
will be pointing the direction

111
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:15,745
that the surface of the sphere would move.

112
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,259
Then when you stick out your thumb,

113
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:20,008
that's the direction that
is the choice of vector

114
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,003
which should describe that rotation.

115
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:23,757
So in the specific example we have here,

116
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:25,506
when you stick out your right thumb,

117
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:28,722
that corresponds to the white
vector, not the green one.

118
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:30,765
But if you did things
the other way around,

119
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:34,932
whoops, move this a little
bit. Get him to stay in place.

120
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:39,008
If you move things the other way around,

121
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:41,129
such that the rotation were going kind of

122
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:42,538
in the opposite direction,

123
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:45,417
then when you imagine curling
the fingers of your right hand

124
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,855
around that direction, your
thumb is going to point

125
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,341
according to the green vector.

126
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:53,477
But with the original rotation
that I started illustrating,

127
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:54,594
it's the white vector,

128
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,260
the white vector is the one to go with.

129
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,498
And this is actually pretty cool, right?

130
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,001
Because you're packing
a lot of information

131
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,208
into that vector.

132
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,007
It tells you what the axis is.

133
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:05,250
It tells you the speed of
rotation via its magnitude.

134
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,637
And then the choice of which
direction along the axis

135
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:10,346
tells you whether the
globe is going one way

136
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:11,516
or if it's going the other.

137
00:05:11,516 --> 00:05:12,816
So with just three numbers,

138
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:15,510
the three dimensional
coordinates of this vector,

139
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,739
you can perfectly describe any one given

140
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,620
three dimensional rotation.

141
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,267
And the reason I'm talking
about this, by the way,

142
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,265
in a series of videos about curl,

143
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:26,521
is because what I'm about to talk about

144
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:29,867
is three dimensional curl
which relates to fluid flow

145
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,506
in three dimensions and
how that induces a rotation

146
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,272
at every single point in space.

147
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:35,920
And what's going to happen
is you're going to associate

148
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,366
a vector with every single point in space

149
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:41,435
to answer the question
what rotation at that point

150
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:43,769
is induced by the certain fluid flow?

151
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:45,371
And I'm getting a little
bit ahead of myself here.

152
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:46,810
For right now you just need to focus

153
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,738
on a single point of rotation

154
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,269
and a single vector corresponding to that.

155
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,459
But it's important to kind
of get your head around

156
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,889
how exactly we represent
this rotation with a vector

157
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:00,464
before moving on to the notably
more cognitively intensive

158
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:02,786
subject of three dimensional curl.

159
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:05,710
So with that, I will see you next video.
