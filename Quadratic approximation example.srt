00:00:01,244 --> 00:00:03,625
- [Voiceover] When we last
left off in the riveting saga

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:06,811
of quadratic approximations
of multi variable functions,

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:10,298
we were approximating a two
variable function, f of xy,

4
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:13,708
and we ended up with this
pretty monstrous expression,

5
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,140
and because it's written its
full abstract form, I almost

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,651
feel like it looks more
monstrous than it needs to,

7
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,435
so I'm going to go ahead
and go through a specific

8
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:23,150
example here, and just to
remind you of kind of what

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,860
all these terms are, how
there's actually kind of a

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,614
pattern to what's going
on, this here represents,

11
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:30,318
you can think of it as the
constant term, where you know

12
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:32,687
this is just going to evaluate
to some kind of number.

13
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:37,043
These two terms are what you
might call the linear term,

14
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:40,288
linear, because if you
actually look, the only places

15
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:43,339
where the variable x
and y comes up is here,

16
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:45,033
where it's just being
multiplied by a constant,

17
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:47,288
and here, where it's just
being multiplied by a constant,

18
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:49,638
so it's just variables
times constant in there.

19
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:51,714
And then all of this stuff
at the end, which is kind of

20
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:54,116
the whole essence of a
quadratic approximation,

21
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:56,716
where you start to have things
like you get an x squared,

22
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:59,415
and you get x gets to be multiplied by y,

23
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:01,958
all of this stuff is the
quadratic term, and though

24
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,879
it seems like a lot now,
you'll see in the context

25
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:06,712
of an actual example, it's
not necessarily as bad

26
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:07,799
as it seems.

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,966
So let's say we're looking
at the function f of xy

28
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,122
and let's say it's going to be

29
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:18,534
e to the x divided by two,

30
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:20,540
multiplied by sin of y.

31
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,044
This is our multi variable function.

32
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:24,844
And let's say we want to
approximate this near some

33
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:26,965
kind of point, and I'm going
to choose a point that's

34
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:30,011
something that we can
actually evaluate these at,

35
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:33,067
so like x, it would be
convenient if that was zero,

36
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:36,468
and then y, I'll go with
pi halves, because that's

37
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:38,719
something where I'll
know how to evaluate sin,

38
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,127
and where I'll know how to
evaluate its derivatives,

39
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:42,074
things like that.

40
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:44,417
So we're trying to
approximate this function near

41
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:45,861
this point.

42
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:47,015
Now first things first.

43
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,116
We're just going to need
to get all of the different

44
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:51,057
partial derivatives and
second partial derivatives.

45
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:52,933
We know we're going to need
them, so let's just kind

46
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,246
of start working it through,
and figuring out what

47
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:56,579
all of them are.

48
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:01,895
Let's start with the partial
derivative with respect to x.

49
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:05,428
So this is also a function of xy,

50
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:07,194
and we look up at the original function,

51
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,663
the only place where x shows
up is in this e to the x

52
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,538
over two, the derivative
of that is one half,

53
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:14,122
we bring down that one half,

54
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:15,801
times e to the x over two,

55
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,713
and this is being multiplied
by something that looks

56
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:20,338
like a constant, as far as x is concerned,

57
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,171
sin of y.

58
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,615
Now when we do the partial
derivative with respect to y,

59
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:27,615
what we get,

60
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,368
this first part just looks
like a constant, so we kind

61
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:33,500
of keep that constant there,
as far as y is concerned,

62
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,498
and the derivative of sin is cosin.

63
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:38,936
Cosin of y.

64
00:02:38,936 --> 00:02:40,632
And then now we

65
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:42,546
let's start taking second
partial derivatives,

66
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:44,071
so I'll start by doing the one where

67
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:48,167
we take the partial derivative
with respect to x twice.

68
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,032
Now here I'll actually do
this in a different color.

69
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:52,759
Let's do yellow.

70
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,857
Just to make clear which
ones are the second

71
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:55,838
partial derivatives.

72
00:02:55,838 --> 00:02:57,879
So partial with respect to x twice,

73
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,237
also, function of xy,
like all of these guys.

74
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,513
So let's look up at the
original partial derivative with

75
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:05,661
respect to x, and we're
now going to take its

76
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:07,682
derivative, again with respect to x.

77
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:09,301
This is the only place where x shows up,

78
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:11,481
that one half kind of comes down again,

79
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:13,709
so now it's going to be one fourth times

80
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,716
e to the x over two,

81
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:17,214
and we just keep that sin of y,

82
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:18,860
because it looks like
we're just multiplying

83
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,860
by a constant, sin of y.

84
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:25,393
Next we'll do the mixed partial
derivative, where you do

85
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:27,877
first with respect to x,
then with respect to y,

86
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:29,379
or you could do it the other
way, because with almost

87
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:30,835
all functions, it kind
of doesn't matter which

88
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,367
order you take the two.

89
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,491
So I'll go ahead and
just look at the one that

90
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,673
was with respect to x,
and now let's think of its

91
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,598
derivative with respect to y.

92
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:39,604
This whole one half e to the x halves

93
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:41,776
looks like a constant,
derivative of sin of y

94
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:43,109
is cosin y.

95
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:47,251
So we take that constant,
the one half e to the

96
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:48,418
x halves,

97
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:53,190
and then we multiply it by
the derivative of sin of y,

98
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,857
which is cosin of y.

99
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,561
And then finally we take
the second derivative,

100
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:01,040
second partial derivative

101
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,873
with respect to y, twice in a row.

102
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,954
So f with respect to y,

103
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:09,204
twice in a row.

104
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:12,458
And for this one, let's
take a look at the partial

105
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,084
derivative with respect to y.

106
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:16,384
This part is the only
part where y shows up,

107
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:18,579
derivative of cosin is negative sin,

108
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,330
and then e to the x halves just
still looks like a constant,

109
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,675
so we'll bring that negative out front,

110
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:25,721
that constant e to the x halves,

111
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:27,721
and it was negative sin,

112
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,353
so that negative went out front,

113
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,896
sin of y.

114
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,468
So that's all of the partial
differential information

115
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,211
that we're going to need.

116
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:38,388
And now we know we're
going to need to evaluate

117
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:41,503
all of these guys, all of
these partial derivatives

118
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:43,675
at the specific point,
because if we go up and

119
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:46,445
look at the original
function that we have,

120
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,428
we're going to need to
evaluate f at this point,

121
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:50,431
both of the partial
derivatives at this point,

122
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:53,414
the second partial derivatives.

123
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:54,969
Oh, I'm realizing, actually,
that I made a little

124
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,079
bit of a mistake here.

125
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,206
This should be a one half

126
00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,820
out in front of each of these guys.

127
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,303
That should be plus
one half of this second

128
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,042
partial derivative, and
one half of this second

129
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:07,221
partial derivative.

130
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:08,727
The mixed partial
derivative it's still one,

131
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:10,010
but these guys should have a one half.

132
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,311
That was a mistake on my part.

133
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,075
In any case, though, we're
going to need to evaluate

134
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:16,575
all of these guys, so if we go back down,

135
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:19,132
let's just start plugging
in the point zero and

136
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:21,146
pi halves to each one of these.

137
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,324
So the function itself,
when we plug in zero,

138
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:26,459
e to the zero is one,
and sin of pi halves,

139
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,339
sin of pi halves is also one,

140
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,452
so this entire thing just comes to one.

141
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:33,562
If we do this for the next one, again

142
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:36,481
e to the zero is going to be one,

143
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:37,978
sin of y is also going to be one,

144
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:40,045
but now we have that
one half sitting there,

145
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:42,293
so that'll end up as one half.

146
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:44,014
If we look at the partial
derivative with respect

147
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:46,764
to y, cosin of pi halves is zero,

148
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:51,169
so this entire thing is going to be zero.

149
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,640
Moving right along, let's
take a look at this second

150
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,024
partial derivative with respect to x.

151
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,359
Again, e to the zero will be one,

152
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,700
and sin of pi halves will be one,

153
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,832
so this ends up just
being that one fourth,

154
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,108
the mixed partial derivative here,

155
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:10,788
if we have one half by the
pattern's starting to continue,

156
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,987
you've got the one, this
one's actually zero,

157
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:15,640
so cosin of pi halves is zero,

158
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,317
so the whole thing will be zero.

159
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:20,098
And then the last one it'll be negative

160
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:22,259
one times that one again,

161
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,654
for sin of pi halves is one,

162
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:28,573
so all of that just comes
out to be negative one.

163
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:30,999
So this, I mean I kind of
chose a convenient example,

164
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,006
where all the derivatives
look very similar to the

165
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:35,503
thing itself, which is
actually pretty common,

166
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:37,912
so we get to leverage
a lot of the work that

167
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:39,222
we did earlier.

168
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:41,270
So now we have these
six different constants,

169
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,320
can't keep them all on the
screen at the same time.

170
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,781
But we've got these six
different constants,

171
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,683
so now we just plug each
one of them in to the

172
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:51,094
quadratic approximation.

173
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:55,495
So if we make our quadratic
approximation of our function,

174
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,295
the first term is that constant term,

175
00:06:57,295 --> 00:07:00,412
so we take a look up and
we say where does f of xy

176
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:03,942
go at this point, and it'll just be one.

177
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:05,077
We're going to have to do
a lot of scrolling back

178
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:06,016
and forth here.

179
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:08,065
There's a lot of text to deal with.

180
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:09,830
The next thing is going to be something

181
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,405
times x minus zero, the
kind of x coordinate

182
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:15,892
of our specified point,

183
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:17,785
and that something is
the first derivative with

184
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:20,713
respect to x, so that's
going to be one half.

185
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:22,530
So come back down here.

186
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,518
That one half.

187
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:26,111
And then similarly, we're
going to have something

188
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,988
multiplied by y minus the y coordinate

189
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:32,380
of the point about which
we are approximating,

190
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,790
and for that we take a look
at the partial derivative

191
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,589
with respect to y, which was just zero,

192
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,210
so that's pretty convenient.

193
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,524
That's just going to end up being zero.

194
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,538
And then for the second
partial derivative terms,

195
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:43,953
maybe I'll actually be able to keep it on

196
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:45,631
the same screen here.

197
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,635
We're going to have
something multiplied by x

198
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,786
minus its coordinate squared,

199
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:54,053
and that something is whatever
the partial derivative

200
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:56,018
with respect to x twice
is, which is one fourth,

201
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:59,185
so we go ahead and plug in one fourth,

202
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:01,841
and then for the mixed partial derivative,

203
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,082
I'll put it down here,

204
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:07,565
it'll be something multiplied
by x, minus its constant,

205
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:08,898
and then y minus

206
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,709
that pi halves,

207
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:14,937
and that something is the
mixed partial derivative,

208
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:16,803
which in this case is zero.

209
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:18,482
Oh and I'm realizing I made
the same mistake again.

210
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:21,399
It's not one fourth, it's one half.

211
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,690
For the same reason that I
made a mistake up here earlier,

212
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,456
where it's actually one
half multiplied by this

213
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:28,956
second partial derivative,
and one half by the second

214
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:32,189
partial derivative there, I
guess I keep forgetting that.

215
00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:35,434
Good lesson, I suppose, that
that's an easy thing to forget,

216
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:37,673
if you find yourself
computing one of these,

217
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:39,714
where I'll put it in here,

218
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:41,677
multiply that guy by one half.

219
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:44,226
It's similar to a Taylor
expansion in single variable

220
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,750
calculus, where you kind
of have to remember what's

221
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,323
what that squared term
would be, has a one half

222
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:50,563
associated with it.

223
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,284
So for that same reason,
now we're going to have,

224
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:54,773
and this time I won't forget it,

225
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:57,683
will be one half multiplied by something,

226
00:08:57,683 --> 00:09:00,683
multiplied by the y minus pi halves,

227
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,648
minus that y coordinate of
the point we're approximating

228
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:06,490
there, and this time that something

229
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,573
is negative one.

230
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:13,764
So we can kind of plug
in here negative one.

231
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:16,783
And now this is something
we can simplify quite a bit,

232
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:19,200
because that one stays there,

233
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:21,759
one half of x minus zero,

234
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,853
that's just x halves,

235
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:25,324
this whole part cancels out to zero,

236
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:26,692
so there's nothing there.

237
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,103
Over here we have half
times a fourth, one eighth

238
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:31,507
times x squared, so that's

239
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:33,757
x squared divided by eight.

240
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,812
This mixed partial
derivative term is zero,

241
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:38,118
so that's pretty nice.

242
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:40,865
And then this last term here is just

243
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,957
negative one half,

244
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,684
so let's see, I'll write
it down as negative

245
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:50,581
one half by y minus pi halves squared,

246
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:53,831
by y minus pi halves squared.

247
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:58,764
So that is the quadratic approximation,

248
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,563
and you can see this actually feels like a

249
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:01,562
quadratic function.

250
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:05,230
We've got up to x squared,
and up to y squared,

251
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,700
and there's a sense in which this is a

252
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,907
simpler function.

253
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,612
I mean, it looks like it's
got more terms than the

254
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:13,788
original one, which was e
to the x halved sin of y,

255
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:16,138
but if it's a computer
that needs to compute these

256
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:18,885
things, for example, it's
much easier to deal with

257
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,339
polynomials, that's a faster thing to do.

258
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,131
Also for theoretical
purposes, it can be nice to

259
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:27,099
deal with just a quadratic
polynomial to make

260
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:28,639
conclusions about things.

261
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,209
We'll see that in the context
of something called the

262
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:32,222
second partial derivative test.

263
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:34,796
But just to get a feel for
what this means, let's pull

264
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:38,046
up the graph of the relevant functions.

265
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:41,555
So this here is the graph
of the original function,

266
00:10:41,555 --> 00:10:43,958
e to the x halves times sin of y,

267
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,394
and the point that
we're approximating near

268
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:48,356
was where x equals zero,

269
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,147
so let's see how we get oriented.

270
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:52,652
X is equal to zero, and then
y is equal to pi halves.

271
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,772
So this is the point
we're approximating near.

272
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:56,786
And the quadratic approximation,
when you plug everything

273
00:10:56,786 --> 00:11:00,178
in, has a graph that looks
like this white surface here.

274
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:02,522
So if I get rid of that
original graph, this is how

275
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,991
we're approximating the
function near that point.

276
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:06,630
And that does a pretty good job, right?

277
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,778
Because even as you step
pretty far away from that

278
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:11,909
point, it's pretty closely
hugging the original surface.

279
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:13,927
If you go very far away,
it certainly doesn't get

280
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:16,364
the oscillating nature
of that sin component,

281
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:18,767
and the exponential
component grows faster than

282
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,807
the quadratic one, but nearby,

283
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:23,553
nearby this actually
gives a very good feel for

284
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:25,432
the shape of the graph.

285
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:26,938
And again, later on we'll
see how this is a pretty

286
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:29,805
useful theoretical tool for
drawing conclusions about

287
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:31,836
qualitative features of
the shape of the graph,

288
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:34,213
the fact that this looks
kind of like a saddle,

289
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:35,765
is going to end up being kind of important

290
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,295
in certain contexts.

291
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:39,328
But before we get to any
of that, in the next couple

292
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:41,982
videos I'm going to talk about a simpler,

293
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:44,398
or rather a more generalizable form,

294
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:46,404
of writing down this
quadratic approximation

295
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:48,118
using vector notation.

296
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:49,720
Because right now we're just limited to

297
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,070
two variables, and you can
imagine how monstrous this

298
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,127
might look if you were
dealing even just with a

299
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:55,334
three variable function,

300
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:57,235
where think of all the
different possible second

301
00:11:57,235 --> 00:11:59,442
partial derivatives of a
three variable function,

302
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:01,471
or a four variable function.

303
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,572
It would quickly get out
of hand, but there is kind

304
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:06,819
of a nice general way
to write all of these.

305
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,638
So with that, I will see you next video.
