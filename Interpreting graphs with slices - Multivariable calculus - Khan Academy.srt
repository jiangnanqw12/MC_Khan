00:00:00,554 --> 00:00:01,785
- [Voiceover] So in the last video

2
00:00:01,785 --> 00:00:04,942
I described how to interpret
three dimensional graphs

3
00:00:04,942 --> 00:00:07,142
and I have another three
dimensional graph here,

4
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:08,804
it's a very bumpy guy.

5
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:12,971
And this happens to be the graph
with the function f of x, y

6
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:16,796
is equal to cosine of x

7
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,669
multiplied by the sine of y

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,610
and you know I could also say like,

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,430
that this graph represents

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,101
I could also say that
this graph represents

11
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,820
z is equal to that whole value

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,300
because we think about
the output of the function

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,522
as the z coordinate of each point

14
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,498
and what I want to do here is describe

15
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:44,447
how you can interpret the
relationship between this graph

16
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:47,197
and these functions that you know

17
00:00:48,093 --> 00:00:50,055
by taking slices of it.

18
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:53,657
So for example let's say
that we took a slice with

19
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:55,326
this plane here

20
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:57,552
and what this plane here is

21
00:00:57,552 --> 00:01:01,135
is it represents the value x equals zero

22
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,701
and you can kinda see that
because this is the x-axis.

23
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:10,047
So when you're at zero on the x-axis

24
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:11,431
you know, you pass through the origin

25
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:13,932
and then the values of
y and z can go freely

26
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:15,432
so you end up with

27
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:17,918
this plane.

28
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:19,699
And let's say you want to just consider

29
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:22,590
where this cuts through the graph, okay,

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,971
so we'll limit our graph

31
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:25,588
just down to the point where it cuts it

32
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:28,815
and I'm going to draw a little
red line over that spot.

33
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,162
Now what you might notice here

34
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:33,030
that red line looks like a sinusoidal wave

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,955
in fact it looks exactly
like the sine function itself

36
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:37,421
you know, passes through the origin

37
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:40,758
it starts by going up and this makes sense

38
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,709
if we start to plug things into

39
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:45,452
the original form here.

40
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:47,035
Because if you take

41
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,864
f and you plug in x equals zero

42
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:54,846
but then we still let y range freely

43
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:59,492
what it means is that you're
looking at cosine of zero

44
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:01,409
multiplied by sine of y

45
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:08,014
And what is cosine of zero?

46
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:11,015
cosine of zero evaluates to one

47
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:13,995
so this whole function should
look just like sine of y

48
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:17,389
in that when we let y run freely

49
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:21,119
the output, which is still
represented by the z coordinate,

50
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,920
will give us this graph that's just a

51
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,597
normal two-dimensional graph

52
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:26,679
that we're probably familiar with.

53
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,319
And let's try this at a different point.

54
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,209
Let's see what would happen if

55
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,091
instead of plugging in x equals zero

56
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:36,924
let's imagine that we
plugged in y equals zero

57
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:40,524
and this time before I graph it

58
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:43,670
and before I show everything that goes on

59
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,769
let's just try to figure out

60
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,734
purely from the formula here

61
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,789
what it's going to look like
when we plug in y equals zero.

62
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:53,013
So now I'm going to write
over on the other side.

63
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:54,245
We have

64
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:56,862
f of x will still run freely

65
00:02:56,862 --> 00:02:59,183
y is going to be fixed as zero

66
00:02:59,183 --> 00:03:01,610
and what this means is we have cosine of x

67
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,881
so maybe expect to see something

68
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,368
that looks kinda like a cosine graph

69
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,201
and then sine of zero.

70
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:11,541
Except, what is sine of zero?

71
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,980
Sine of zero cancels out
and just becomes zero

72
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,567
which multiplied by cosine of x

73
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:20,059
means everything cancels
out and becomes zero

74
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,309
so what you'd expect is that this

75
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:23,127
is going to look like a constant function

76
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:25,031
that's constantly equal to zero.

77
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,633
And let's see if that's what we get.

78
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,363
So I'm going to slice it with

79
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:29,863
y equals zero here

80
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,054
and you look at the y axis

81
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:34,224
we see when it's zero

82
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:35,970
and x and z both run freely.

83
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,042
I'm going to chop off
my graph at that point,

84
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,830
and indeed it chops it
just at this straight line,

85
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,997
the straight line that goes
right along the x-axis.

86
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,292
But let's say that we did a
different constant value of y.

87
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:54,459
Rather than y equals zero,

88
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,573
and we'll erase all of this,

89
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,823
let's say that I cut things

90
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:06,794
at some other value.

91
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:09,461
So in this case what I've chosen

92
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:12,490
is y is equal to pi halves

93
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:16,467
and it looks

94
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:20,819
kinda like we've got a wave here

95
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:22,281
and it looks like a cosine wave

96
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:24,800
and you can probably
see where this is going.

97
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,651
This is when x is running freely

98
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:29,066
and if we start to
imagine plugging this in

99
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:32,329
I'll just actually write it out.

100
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,593
We've got cosine of x

101
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:38,760
and then y is held at a
constant sine of pi halves.

102
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:42,499
Sine of pi halves is just,

103
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,241
this just always equals one

104
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:45,645
so we could replace this with one

105
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:46,876
which means the function as a whole

106
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:48,710
should look like cosine x.

107
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,989
So again the multi-variable function

108
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,843
we've frozen y and we're
letting x range freely

109
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:55,593
and it ends up looking
like a cosine function

110
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:58,356
and I think a really
good way to understand

111
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:01,395
a given three-dimensional
graph when you see it,

112
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:02,562
let's say you,

113
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,092
you look back at the original graph

114
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:08,170
when we don't have anything going on.

115
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,306
Get rid of that little line.

116
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:10,246
So you've got this graph

117
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:11,583
and it looks wavy and bumpy

118
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,534
and a little bit hard
to understand at first

119
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:15,269
but if you just think in terms of

120
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:17,063
holding one variable constant

121
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:19,725
it boils down always into

122
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,315
a normal two-dimensional graph

123
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:22,450
and you can even think about,

124
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,911
as you're lighting planes,
kinda slide back and forth

125
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,119
what that means for the

126
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,417
amplitude of the wave that you see

127
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:30,734
and things like that.

128
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,701
This become especially
important, by the way,

129
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:36,868
when we introduce a notion
of partial derivatives.
