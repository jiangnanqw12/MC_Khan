1
00:00:00,744 --> 00:00:03,786
- [Voiceover] So here I'm
gonna talk about the Laplacian.

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:04,619
Laplacian.

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,942
And the Laplacian is a certain operator

4
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:09,985
in the same way that the
divergence, or the gradient,

5
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:13,050
or the curl, or even just
the derivative are operators.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,071
The things that take in
some kind of function

7
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:16,650
and give you another function.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,506
So in this case, let's say we
have a multivariable function

9
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:23,825
like F, that just takes in
a two-dimensional input,

10
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:25,241
F of X Y.

11
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:28,167
So you might imagine its graph
as being something like this,

12
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:31,232
where the input space
is this X-Y plane here,

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,286
so each of the points,
X Y, is a point here,

14
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:35,609
and then the output is just given

15
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,467
by the height of that graph.

16
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:39,603
So the Laplacian of F is denoted

17
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:41,600
with a right-side-up triangle,

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,595
and it's gonna give you a
new scalar valued function

19
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:45,431
of X and Y.

20
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:47,034
So it's gonna give you a new function

21
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:49,100
that takes in a two-dimensional input

22
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,516
and just outputs a number.

23
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:53,071
And it's kind of like a second derivative,

24
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:54,510
because the way that it's defined

25
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,018
is that you take the divergence

26
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:58,268
of the gradient

27
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:02,806
of your function F.

28
00:01:02,806 --> 00:01:04,083
So that's kind of how it's defined,

29
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,824
the divergence of the gradient of F.

30
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:08,252
And a more common notation
that you might see here

31
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:11,476
is to take that upside-down
triangle, nabla,

32
00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:12,925
dot product,

33
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:14,449
with nabla

34
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,282
of F.

35
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:18,791
So remember, if F is a
scalar valued function,

36
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,369
then the gradient of F
gives you a vector field,

37
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:22,715
a certain vector field.

38
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,130
But the divergence of a vector field

39
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,267
gives you another scalar valued function.

40
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,797
So this is the sense in which
it's a second derivative.

41
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:31,818
But let's see if we can kind
of understand intuitively

42
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:33,466
what this should mean.

43
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:35,324
'Cause the gradient, if you remember,

44
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:37,576
gives you the slope of steepest descent.

45
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:41,315
So it's a vector field
in the input space of X.

46
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:43,613
And each one of the vectors
points in the direction

47
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:45,773
that you should walk, such that this graph

48
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,700
is kind of a hill on top of you,

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,256
it tells you the direction you should go

50
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:52,762
to increase your direction
the most rapidly.

51
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,643
And if that seems unfamiliar,
it doesn't make sense,

52
00:01:54,643 --> 00:01:57,870
maybe go take a look at that
video on gradients and graphs

53
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,798
and how they relate to each other.

54
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:02,120
So with the specific graph
that I have pictured here,

55
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,209
when you have kind of the top of a hill,

56
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,812
all of the points around it,

57
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:07,158
the direction that you should walk,

58
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:09,248
is towards the top of that hill.

59
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:10,920
Whereas when you have
kind of like the bottom,

60
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,219
a little goalie here,

61
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,658
all of the directions you should walk

62
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:16,818
to increase the value of
the function most rapidly,

63
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:19,102
are directly away from that value,

64
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:21,912
which you might call a local minimum.

65
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:24,188
So let's temporarily get rid of the graph,

66
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:25,627
just so we can look at the gradient field

67
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:27,020
here pretty clearly.

68
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,739
And now let's think
about what the divergence

69
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,457
is supposed to represent.

70
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:33,127
So now the divergence, and
again if this feels unfamiliar,

71
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:36,100
maybe go back and take a look
at the divergence videos,

72
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,700
but that divergence has you
imagining that this vector field

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,115
corresponds to some kind of fluid flow.

74
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:43,623
So you imagine little
like water molecules,

75
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:46,734
and at any given moment,
they're moving along the vector

76
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,429
that they're attached to.

77
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,217
So for example, if you
had a water molecule

78
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:51,773
that started off kind of here,

79
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,816
you would start by going along that vector

80
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:55,604
and then kind of follow the ones near it,

81
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:59,018
and it looks like it kind
of ends up in this spot.

82
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:00,643
And a lot of the water molecules seem to

83
00:03:00,643 --> 00:03:02,292
kind of converge over there.

84
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:05,115
Whereas over here, the water
molecules tend to go away

85
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:06,681
when they're following those vectors

86
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:08,469
away from this point.

87
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:09,546
And when they go away like that,

88
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:10,962
when you have a whole bunch of vectors

89
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,379
kind of pointed away,

90
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:14,376
that's an indication that
divergence is positive,

91
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:16,001
because they're diverging away.

92
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,230
So over here, divergence is positive.

93
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,761
Whereas the opposite case,
where all of the water molecules

94
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:22,549
are kind of coming in towards a point,

95
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,569
that's where divergence is negative.

96
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:26,172
And in another area, let's
say it was kinda like

97
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,633
this center point, where you
have some water molecules

98
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,189
that looks like they're coming in,

99
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:31,744
but other ones are going out,

100
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,857
and at least from this
picture, it doesn't seem like

101
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:35,831
the ones going out are
doing so at a faster rate

102
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,248
or slower than they are here.

103
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:39,477
This would be roughly zero divergence.

104
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:41,265
So now let's think
about what it might mean

105
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:44,678
when you take the divergence
of the gradient field of F.

106
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:46,977
So let me kind of clear
up the markings I made

107
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,637
on top of it here.

108
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:50,103
Points of high divergence,

109
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:52,100
points where it diverges a lot here,

110
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,167
why are those vectors pointing away?

111
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,256
And if we pull up the graph again,

112
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:57,464
the reason they're pointing away

113
00:03:57,464 --> 00:03:59,484
is 'cause the direction of steepest descent

114
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:02,549
is kind of uphill everywhere;
you are in a valley.

115
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,383
Whereas in the opposite circumstance,

116
00:04:04,383 --> 00:04:06,729
where divergence is highly negative,

117
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:08,818
'cause points are converging towards it,

118
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:10,188
why are they pointing towards it?

119
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:11,674
Well this is a gradient field,

120
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:13,439
so they're pointing towards that spot,

121
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,133
because that's where anywhere around it,

122
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:19,035
you should walk towards
that spot to go uphill.

123
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:21,729
So in other words, the
divergence of the gradient

124
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,260
is very high at points that are

125
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,322
kind of like minima, at points
where everyone around them

126
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:28,751
tends to be higher.

127
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:31,236
But the divergence of the gradient is low

128
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,674
at points that look more
like maximum points,

129
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,253
where when you evaluate the function

130
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:37,482
at all of the points
around that input point,

131
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:38,805
they give something smaller.

132
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:41,940
So this Laplacian operator
is kind of like a measure

133
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,352
of how much of a minimum
point is this X Y.

134
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,861
You will be very positive

135
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:50,044
when F evaluated at that point

136
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:51,831
tends to give a smaller value

137
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:54,246
than F evaluated at
neighbors of that point.

138
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:55,756
But it'll be very negative

139
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:57,590
if when you evaluate F at that point

140
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,819
it tends to be bigger than its neighbors.

141
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,166
And this should feel kind of analogous

142
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,999
to the second derivative
in ordinary calculus,

143
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,138
when you have some kind of graph

144
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,926
of just a single variable function,

145
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:09,713
the second derivative of X

146
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,733
will be low, it'll be negative

147
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:14,217
at points where it kind of
looks like a local maximum.

148
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,748
But over here, the second derivative of x

149
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:19,209
would be positive at points that kind of

150
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,626
look like a local minimum.

151
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:22,530
SO in that way, the Laplacian is sort of

152
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,014
an analog of the second derivative

153
00:05:25,014 --> 00:05:28,265
for scalar valued multivariable functions.

154
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:30,671
And in the next video, I'll
go through an example of that.
