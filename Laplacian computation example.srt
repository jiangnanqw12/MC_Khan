1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:02,116
- [Voiceover] In the last
video, I started introducing

2
00:00:02,116 --> 00:00:04,903
the intuition for the Laplacian operator

3
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:07,132
in the context of the
function with this graph

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,384
and with the gradient
field pictured below it.

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,009
And here, I'd like to go
through the computation

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,681
involved in that.

7
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:15,421
So the function that I
had there was defined,

8
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,163
it's a two-variable function.

9
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:20,112
And it's defined as f(x,y)

10
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:21,969
is equal to three

11
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:26,969
plus cos(x/2)

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,530
multiplied by sin(y/2).

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,459
And then the Laplacian which we define

14
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:38,664
with this right side up triangle

15
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,475
is an operator of f.

16
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:42,960
And it's defined to be the divergence,

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,702
so kind of this nabla dot

18
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:48,904
times the gradient which
is just nabla of f.

19
00:00:48,904 --> 00:00:50,274
So two different things going on.

20
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:51,877
It's kind of like a second derivative.

21
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:53,246
And the first thing we need to do

22
00:00:53,246 --> 00:00:54,802
is take the gradient of f.

23
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:55,708
And the way we do that,

24
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:56,822
we kind of imagine expanding

25
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:58,634
this upside down triangle

26
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:01,675
as a vector full of partial
differential operators:

27
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,742
partial partial x

28
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:08,363
and partial partial y.

29
00:01:08,363 --> 00:01:09,965
And with a gradient,
you just kind of imagine

30
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:11,753
multiplying that by the function.

31
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:13,053
So if you imagine multiplying that

32
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:16,095
by the function, what it looks like

33
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:18,788
is just a vector full
of partial derivatives.

34
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,391
So you're taking the partial of f

35
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:24,222
with respect to x and the partial of f

36
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:25,220
with respect to y.

37
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,590
Those are the two different components

38
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,482
of this vector-valued
function that is the gradient.

39
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:31,415
And in our specific example,

40
00:01:31,415 --> 00:01:33,134
when we take the partial derivative of f

41
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,154
with respect to x

42
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:37,151
what we get, is we look over here.

43
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:38,590
Three just looks like a constant,

44
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,728
so nothing happens.

45
00:01:39,728 --> 00:01:41,377
Cos(x) halves.

46
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:43,165
The derivative of that with respect to x,

47
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,649
we kind of take out that 1/2.

48
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:49,809
So 1/2, and the derivative of cos is -sin.

49
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:54,736
So that's -sin(x/2).

50
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:59,668
And sin(y/2), well, y just
looks like a constant.

51
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:02,548
So sin(y/2) is just some other constant.

52
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:05,636
So in our derivative, we just
keep that constant in there,

53
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:10,112
that sin(y/2).

54
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,718
And then, for the second component,

55
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:14,367
the partial derivative of f

56
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,574
with respect to y.

57
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:16,712
Three still looks like a constant

58
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:17,989
cause it is a constant.

59
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:20,264
Now, cos(x/2) looks like a constant

60
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:21,844
because as far as y is concerned,

61
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:22,865
x is a constant.

62
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:24,746
So cos(x) is a constant.

63
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:28,833
But then, the sin(y)
has a derivative of cos.

64
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,435
And we also take out that 1/2.

65
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:32,757
So you take out that 1/2

66
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:34,707
when you take the derivative of the inside

67
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:36,774
and then the derivative of the outside

68
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:40,071
is cosine of whatever was in there.

69
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:43,136
So in this case, y/2.

70
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:45,296
And we're multiplying it
by that original constant,

71
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:47,362
cos(x/2).

72
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:50,613
So, still we have our cos(x/2)

73
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:55,489
since it was a constant times
a certain variable thing, x/2.

74
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,440
So that's the gradient.

75
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,717
And then, the next step here

76
00:02:58,717 --> 00:03:01,271
is to take the divergence of that.

77
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,687
So with the divergence,
we're going to imagine

78
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:05,543
taking that del operator
and dot producting

79
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:06,565
with this guy.

80
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:08,910
So if I scroll down to
give some room here,

81
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,255
we're going to take that,

82
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,067
that vector that's kind
of the same vector,

83
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,205
the partial partial x.

84
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:16,387
And I say vector, but vector-ish thing,

85
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:19,104
partial partial y.

86
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:19,940
And now we're going to take

87
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,519
the dot product with this entire guy.

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,146
So I'll go ahead and just copy it over.

89
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:29,803
Just kind of copy it over here.

90
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:31,382
And let's see.

91
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:35,393
So, I need a little bit
more room to evaluate this.

92
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:37,646
So here, when you imagine
taking the dot product,

93
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:40,107
you kind of multiply these
top components together.

94
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:41,384
So we're taking the partial derivative

95
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:44,008
with respect to x of this whole guy.

96
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:46,214
And when you do that, well you get,

97
00:03:46,214 --> 00:03:48,373
you still have that 1/2

98
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:51,624
and then the derivative of -sin(x/2).

99
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:53,760
So that 1/2 gets pulled out

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,643
when you're kind of taking

101
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:55,850
the derivative of the inside.

102
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,891
And the derivative of -sin is -cos.

103
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,723
So -cos of that stuff on the inside,

104
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:06,113
that x/2.

105
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,617
And of course, we still
multiply it by this.

106
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:09,754
This looks like a constant, the sin(y/2).

107
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:11,713
And we multiply by that,

108
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:15,713
sin(y/2).

109
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:18,275
And then we add that

110
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:19,483
because it's kind of like a dot product.

111
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:20,876
You add that to what it looks like

112
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:23,105
when you multiply these
next two components.

113
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:24,220
So we're going to add.

114
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,961
And you have that 1/2.

115
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:29,978
And then cos(y/2), when
we differentiate that

116
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,371
you also pull out the 1/2.

117
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,436
So again, you have that pulled-out 1/2.

118
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:37,153
And the derivative of cos is -sin.

119
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:40,520
So now we're taking -sin of,

120
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,653
and then that stuff on the inside, y/2.

121
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,882
And we continue multiplying
by the constant.

122
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:50,017
As far as y is concerned,
cos(x/2) is a constant.

123
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:55,006
So we multiply it by that, cos(x/2).

124
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,278
And then that, so that is the divergence

125
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,671
of that gradient field.

126
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,343
So the divergence of the gradient

127
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:05,523
of our original function
gives us the Laplacian.

128
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:07,264
And in fact, we could
simplify this further

129
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,286
because both of these terms

130
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,516
kind of look identical.

131
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:10,747
But the main point of this video

132
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:12,721
is kind of how you go through that process

133
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:14,718
where you imagine taking the gradient

134
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:17,063
of your function and then
the divergence of that.

135
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:19,547
And that's what the Laplacian is.

136
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:20,529
See you next video.
