00:00:00,422 --> 00:00:01,360
- [Voiceover] Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,886
So what I'd like to do
here and in the following

3
00:00:02,886 --> 00:00:05,136
few videos is talk about how you take the

4
00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:08,529
partial derivative of
vector valued functions.

5
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:10,448
So the kind of thing I have in mind

6
00:00:10,448 --> 00:00:12,957
will be a function with
a multi-variable input,

7
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:16,333
so this specific example have
a two variable input, p and s.

8
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,101
You could think of that
as a two-dimensional space

9
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,091
as the input or just two separate numbers.

10
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,862
And its output will be three-dimensional.

11
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:27,158
The first component, p
squared minus s-squared.

12
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:30,575
The y component will be s times t.

13
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:34,973
And that z component
will be t times s-squared

14
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:39,140
minus s times t-squared,
minus s times t-squared.

15
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:42,980
And the way that you
compute a partial derivative

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,548
of a guy like this, is actually
relatively straight-forward.

17
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,452
If you're to just guess
what it might mean,

18
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:50,715
you'll probably guess right.

19
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:53,443
It will look like partial
of v with respect to

20
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:56,268
one of its input variables,
and I'll choose t

21
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:58,258
with respect to t.

22
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,881
And you just do it component-wise,

23
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:02,572
which means you look at each component

24
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:04,209
and you with a partial derivative to that

25
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,048
'cause each component is just a normal

26
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,646
scaler valued function.

27
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:10,054
So you go up to the top one and you say

28
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:11,566
t-squared looks like a variable,

29
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:15,348
as far t is concerned,
and this derivative is 2t.

30
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:16,948
But s-squared looks like a constant,

31
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:18,954
so its derivative is zero.

32
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,298
S times t, when s looks like a constant

33
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:23,987
and when t looks like a variable,

34
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:26,196
has a derivative of s.

35
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:29,487
Then t times s-squared,
when t's the variable

36
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:32,322
and s is the constant, just
looks like that constant,

37
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:35,892
which is s-squared
minus s times t-squared.

38
00:01:35,892 --> 00:01:38,393
So now a derivative of t-squared is 2t

39
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:39,725
and that constant s stays in.

40
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,725
So that two times s times t.

41
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,895
And that's how you compute it,

42
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:47,923
probably relatively straightforward.

43
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:50,553
The way you do it with
respect to s is very similar,

44
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:52,641
but where this gets fun
and where this gets cool

45
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:55,271
is how you interpret the
partial derivative, right,

46
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,697
how you interpret this
value that we just found.

47
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,349
And what that means
depends a lot on how you

48
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,290
actually visualize the function.

49
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,204
So what I'll go ahead
and do in the next video

50
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:06,341
and in the next few ones, is talk about

51
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:07,174
visualizing this function.

52
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:08,502
It'll be as a parametric surface

53
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:09,776
and three-dimensional space.

54
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:12,433
That's why I got my
grapher program out here

55
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,988
and I think you'll find
there's actually a very

56
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:17,109
satisfying understanding
of what this value means.
