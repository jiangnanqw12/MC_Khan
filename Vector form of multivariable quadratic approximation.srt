00:00:00,245 --> 00:00:02,226
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
we are finally ready

2
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:04,937
to express the quadratic approximation

3
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:07,752
of a multivariable
function in vector form.

4
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:09,517
So, I have the whole
thing written out here

5
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:12,413
where f is the function that
we are trying to approximate,

6
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,782
x naught, y naught is the constant point

7
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,652
about which we are approximating,

8
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:18,478
and then this entire expression

9
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:20,109
is the quadratic approximation,

10
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:21,261
which I've talked about in past videos,

11
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:23,378
and if it seems very
complicated or absurd,

12
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:24,559
or you're unfamiliar with it,

13
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,221
I'm just dissecting it real quick.

14
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:27,870
This over here is the Constant term,

15
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,942
this is just gonna evaluate to a constant,

16
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:34,007
everything over here is the Linear term,

17
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:35,635
because it just involves taking a variable

18
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,263
multiplied by a constant,

19
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:40,774
and then the remainder,
every one of these components

20
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,903
will have two variables
multiplied into it.

21
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:45,472
So x squared comes up, and x times y,

22
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:49,639
and y squared comes up, so
that's the quadratic term.

23
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:51,415
Quadratic.

24
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:54,897
Now, to vectorize things, first of all,

25
00:00:54,897 --> 00:00:57,878
let's write down the input,
the input variable (x,y)

26
00:00:57,878 --> 00:00:59,815
as a vector, and typically we'll do that

27
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:03,094
with a boldfaced x to
indicate that it's a vector,

28
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:07,088
and its components are just
gonna be the single variables,

29
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:08,928
x and y, the non-boldfaced.

30
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:11,750
So this is the vector
representing the variable input,

31
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,543
and then correspondingly a boldfaced x

32
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:17,031
with a little subscript o, x naught,

33
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:19,320
is gonna be the constant input,

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,487
the single point in space near
which we are approximating.

35
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:25,871
So when we write things like that,

36
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:27,455
this Constant term, simply enough,

37
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,493
is gonna look like
evaluating your function

38
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:31,993
at that boldfaced x naught.

39
00:01:32,987 --> 00:01:35,070
So that's probably the
easiest one to handle.

40
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,075
Now the linear term, this
looks like a dot product,

41
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,757
and if we kind of expand
it out as the dot product,

42
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:43,530
it looks like we're taking
the partial derivative

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,957
of f with respect to x,

44
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:47,504
and then the partial
derivative with respect to y,

45
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:49,325
and we're evaluating both of those

46
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:52,325
at that boldfaced x naught input.

47
00:01:53,652 --> 00:01:55,844
X naught as its input.

48
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:57,497
Now, each one of those partial derivatives

49
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,610
is multiplied by variable
minus constant numbers,

50
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,049
so this looks like taking the dot product,

51
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,382
here, I'm gonna erase the word "linear".

52
00:02:07,683 --> 00:02:10,927
We're taking with x minus x naught,

53
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:12,677
and y minus y naught.

54
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:16,307
This is just expressing
the same linear term,

55
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:18,537
but as a dot product,
but the convenience here

56
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:20,449
is that this is totally the same thing

57
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,782
as saying the gradient of f,

58
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:26,392
that's the vector that contains
all the partial derivatives,

59
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:30,059
evaluated at the special input, x naught,

60
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,800
and then we're taking the
dot product between that

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,967
and the variable vector,
boldfaced x, minus x naught.

62
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:42,181
Since when you do this component-wise,

63
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:44,293
boldfaced x minus x naught,
if we kinda think here,

64
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:46,510
it'll be x the variable
minus x naught the constant,

65
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,583
y the variable minus
y naught the constant,

66
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,292
which is what we have up there.

67
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:53,045
So this expression kind of
vectorizes the whole linear term,

68
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:54,966
and now the beef here, the hard part,

69
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,055
how are we gonna vectorize
this quadratic term?

70
00:02:58,055 --> 00:03:00,324
Now that's what I was leading
to in the last couple videos,

71
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:03,071
where I talked about how
you express a quadratic form

72
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,732
like this with a matrix,
and the way that you do it,

73
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:08,416
I'm just kinda scroll
down to give us some room,

74
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,748
the way that you do it
is we'll have a matrix

75
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:13,848
whose components are
all of these constants.

76
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:16,290
It'll be this 1/2 times the
second partial derivative

77
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,828
evaluated there, and I'm just
gonna, for convenience's sake,

78
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:21,757
I'm gonna just take 1/2 times
the second partial derivative

79
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:23,486
with respect to x, and
leave it as understood

80
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,524
that we're evaluating it at this point.

81
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,373
And then, on the other diagonal,

82
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,460
you have 1/2 times the other
kind of partial derivative

83
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,791
with respect to y two times in a row.

84
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,782
And then we're gonna multiply
it by this constant here,

85
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,249
but this term kind of gets broken apart

86
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:39,589
into two different components.

87
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:41,276
If you'll remember, in
the quadratic form video,

88
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:43,015
it was always things where it was a,

89
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:47,350
and then 2b and c, as your
constants for the quadratic form,

90
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,794
so if we're interpreting
this as two times something,

91
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:51,982
then it gets broken down,

92
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,815
and on one corner shows up as fxy,

93
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,088
and on the other one, kind of 1/2 fxy.

94
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:01,832
So both of these together
are gonna constitute

95
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:04,832
the entire mixed partial derivative.

96
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:08,599
And then the way that we
express the quadratic form

97
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,824
is we're gonna multiply
this by, well by what?

98
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:14,056
Well, the first component
is whatever the thing is

99
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:18,813
that's squared here, so it's
gonna be that x minus x naught,

100
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,024
and then the second component is

101
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:22,151
whatever the other thing squared is,

102
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:25,401
which in this case is y minus y naught,

103
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,863
and of course we take that same vector

104
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:31,391
but we put it in on the other side too.

105
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,192
So let me make a little bit of room,

106
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:36,569
cause this is gonna be wide.

107
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:39,019
So we're gonna take that same vector,

108
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,740
and then kind of put it on its side.

109
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,594
So it'll be x minus x naught
as the first component,

110
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:47,865
and then y minus y naught
as the second component,

111
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:50,329
but it's written horizontally, and this,

112
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,332
if you multiply out the entire matrix,

113
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:54,875
is gonna give us the same
expression that you have up here.

114
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,658
And if that seems
unfamiliar, if that seems,

115
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:58,556
you know, how do you
go from there to there,

116
00:04:58,556 --> 00:05:00,749
check out the video on quadratic forms,

117
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:02,886
or you can check out the
article where I'm talking

118
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,271
about the quadratic
approximation as a whole,

119
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,391
I kind of go through
the computation there.

120
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,958
Now, this matrix right here
is almost the Hessian matrix,

121
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,174
this is why I made a video
about the Hessian matrix.

122
00:05:13,174 --> 00:05:14,485
It's not quite, because everything

123
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:16,101
has a 1/2 multiplied into it,

124
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:17,229
so I'm just gonna kinda take that out

125
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,612
and we'll remember we have to multiply

126
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:20,693
a 1/2 in at some point, but otherwise,

127
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:22,949
it is the Hessian matrix, which we denote

128
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:26,274
with a kind of boldfaced H, boldfaced H,

129
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:28,799
and emphasize that it's the Hessian of f.

130
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,813
The Hessian is something
you take of a function.

131
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:32,493
And like I said, remember
each of these terms

132
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:34,352
we should be thinking of as evaluated

133
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:36,068
on the special input point,

134
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,990
evaluating it at that special, you know,

135
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,812
boldfaced x naught input point.

136
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:42,515
I was just kind of too
lazy to write it in,

137
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:44,064
each time the x naught y
naught, x naught y naught,

138
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:45,729
x naught y naught, all of that.

139
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,896
But what we have then is we're
multiplying it on the right

140
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:53,543
by this whole vector is the
variable vector, boldfaced x,

141
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:58,456
minus boldfaced x naught, that's
what that entire vector is,

142
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:00,911
and then we kind of have
the same thing on the right,

143
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:05,675
you know, boldfaced
vector x minus x naught,

144
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:08,135
except that we transpose it,
we kind of put it on its side,

145
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:08,968
and the way you denote that,

146
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,465
you have a little T there, for transpose.

147
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:15,698
So this term captures all
of the quadratic information

148
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:18,566
that we need for the approximation.

149
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,402
So just to put it all together,

150
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:23,434
if we go back up and we put
the Constant term that we have,

151
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:25,458
the Linear term, and this quadratic form

152
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,569
that we just found, all together,

153
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:30,953
what we get is that the
quadratic approximation of f,

154
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:33,553
which is a function we'll
think of it as a vector input,

155
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:37,915
boldfaced x, it equals the
function itself evaluated at,

156
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:41,696
you know, whatever point
we're approximating near,

157
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:44,215
plus the gradient of f, which is kind of,

158
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:46,778
it's vector analog of a derivative,

159
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:50,454
evaluated at that point, so
this is a constant vector,

160
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:53,537
dot product with the variable vector,

161
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:58,690
x minus the constant vector x naught,

162
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:04,812
that whole thing, plus 1/2
the, then we'll just copy down

163
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:06,878
this whole quadratic term up there,

164
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:09,461
the variable minus the constant

165
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:14,861
multiplied by the Hessian,

166
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:16,263
which is kind of like an extension

167
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:19,865
of the second derivative,
two multivariable functions,

168
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:21,147
and we're evaluating that, no, let's see,

169
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:24,041
we're evaluating it at the constant,

170
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:28,217
at the constant, x naught,
and then on the right side,

171
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:32,384
we're multiplying it by the
variable, x minus x naught.

172
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,579
And this, this is the
quadratic approximation

173
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,730
in vector form, and the
important part is, now,

174
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,144
it doesn't just have to be
of a two variable input.

175
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:44,896
You could imagine plugging
in a three variable input,

176
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:47,529
or a four variable input, and
all of these terms make sense.

177
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,856
You know, you take the gradient
of a four variable function,

178
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:51,466
you'll get a vector with four components.

179
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:53,816
You take the Hessian of
a four variable function,

180
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:55,629
you would get a four by four matrix.

181
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,401
And all of these terms make sense.

182
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:59,185
And I think it's also
prettier to write it this way,

183
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:01,465
because it looks a lot more
like a Taylor expansion

184
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:03,493
in the single variable world.

185
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:05,186
You have, you know, a constant term,

186
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:08,746
plus the value of a derivative,
times x minus a constant,

187
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:11,705
plus 1/2 what's kind of like
the second derivative term,

188
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:13,445
what's kind of like taking an x squared,

189
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:16,098
but this is how it looks
in the vector world.

190
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:17,826
So in that way it's
actually maybe a little bit

191
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:19,598
more familiar than writing it out

192
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,630
in the full, you know,
component by component term,

193
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,055
where it's easy to kind of
get lost in the weeds there.

194
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:29,848
So, full vectorized form of
the quadratic approximation

195
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:32,922
of a scalar valued multivariable function.

196
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:34,295
Boy, is that a lot to say.
