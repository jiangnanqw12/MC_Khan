00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:01,770
- [Voiceover] Hello and welcome

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,034
to multivariable calculus.

3
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:05,439
So I think I should probably start off

4
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:08,339
by addressing the elephant
in the living room here.

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,816
I am, sadly, not Sal,

6
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:11,139
but I'm still gonna teach you some math.

7
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,618
My name is Grant.

8
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:14,912
I'm pretty much a math enthusiast.

9
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:17,710
I enjoy making animations
of things when applicable,

10
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,929
and boy, is that applicable

11
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,193
when it comes to multivariable calculus.

12
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:22,935
So, the first thing we gotta get straight

13
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:25,640
is what is this word multivariable

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,172
that separates calculus, as we know it,

15
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:30,830
from the new topic that
you're about to study?

16
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,616
Well, I could say it's all
about multivariable functions,

17
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,253
that doesn't really answer anything

18
00:00:35,253 --> 00:00:36,774
because what's a multivariable function?

19
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:39,340
And basically, the kinds of functions

20
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,953
that we're used to dealing with,

21
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:44,680
in the old world, in the
ordinary calculus world,

22
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,373
will have a single input,
some kind of number

23
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:48,477
as their input,

24
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:50,392
and then the output is
just a single number.

25
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:52,575
And you would call this a
single variable function.

26
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:56,209
Basically because that guy
there is the single variable.

27
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:58,161
So then a multivariable function

28
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:01,250
is something that handles
multiple variables.

29
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,697
So, you know, it's common
to write it as x, y,

30
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,439
it doesn't really matter
what letters to use,

31
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,749
and it could be, you know, x, y, z,

32
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:09,874
x one, x two, x three,
a whole bunch of things,

33
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:11,360
but just to get started,

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,310
we often think just two variables

35
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,133
and this will output
something that depends on

36
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,889
both of those.

37
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:18,639
Commonly it will output just a number,

38
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,218
so you might imagine a
number that depends on

39
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:23,992
x and y in some way,
like, x squared plus y,

40
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:26,151
but it could also output a vector, right?

41
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,160
So you could also imagine something that's

42
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,500
got multivariable input, f of x, y,

43
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,578
and it outputs something that also has

44
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,552
multiple variables, like,

45
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:39,270
I mean I'm just making stuff up here,

46
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,080
three x and, you know, two y.

47
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,332
And, this isn't set in stone,

48
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:46,039
but the convention is to usually think

49
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,315
if there's multiple numbers
that go into the output,

50
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:49,452
think of it as a vector,

51
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,438
if there's multiple numbers
that go into the input,

52
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:52,621
just kind of write them,

53
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,951
write them more sideways like this,

54
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:56,380
and think of them as a point in space.

55
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,311
Because, I mean when you
look at something like this,

56
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:00,435
and you've got an x and you've got a y,

57
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:02,653
you could think about those
as two separate numbers.

58
00:02:02,653 --> 00:02:03,837
You know, here's your number line

59
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,730
with the point x on it somewhere,

60
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,168
maybe that's five, maybe that's three,

61
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,411
it doesn't really matter.

62
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:10,637
And then you've got another number line

63
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:12,150
and it's y, and you could think of them

64
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,520
as separate entities.

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,900
But, it would probably be more accurate

66
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,396
to call it multidimensional calculus,

67
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:20,977
because, really, instead
of thinking of, you know,

68
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:22,877
x and y as separate entities,

69
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,538
whenever you see two things like that

70
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:26,569
you're gonna be thinking
about the x y plane.

71
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,090
And thinking about just a single point.

72
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,081
And you'd think of this as a
function that takes a point

73
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:31,022
to a number,

74
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:32,589
or a point to a vector.

75
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:33,866
And a lot of people, when they start

76
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:35,201
teaching multivariable calculus,

77
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:36,606
they just jump into the calculus,

78
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:37,546
and there's lots of fun things,

79
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:39,268
partial derivatives, gradients,

80
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:40,569
good stuff that you'll learn.

81
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,865
But I think first of all,

82
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:43,470
I want to spend a couple videos

83
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,965
just talking about the different ways

84
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,065
we visualize the different types

85
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:49,215
of multivariable functions.

86
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:50,608
So, as a sneak peak,

87
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:52,105
I'm just gonna go through a couple of them

88
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,359
really quickly right now,

89
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,159
just so you kind of whet your appetite

90
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,447
and see what I'm getting at,

91
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:58,038
but the next few videos are
going to go through them

92
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:00,128
in much, much more detail.

93
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:03,356
So, first of all, graphs.

94
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:04,981
When you have multivariable functions,

95
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:07,024
graphs become three dimensional.

96
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:08,522
But these only really apply
to functions that have

97
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,228
some kind of two-dimensional input,

98
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:11,436
which you might think about as living

99
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:12,667
on this x y plane,

100
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,180
and a single number as their output

101
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,697
and the height of the graph

102
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,589
is gonna correspond with that output.

103
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:19,586
Like I said, you'll be
able to learn much more

104
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:21,636
about that in the dedicated video on it,

105
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:23,986
but these functions also can be visualized

106
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,599
just in two dimensions,
flattening things out.

107
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,978
Where we visualize the entire input space

108
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:31,079
in associated color, with each point.

109
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,079
So this is the kind of
thing where you, you know,

110
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,076
you have some function

111
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:36,166
that's got a two-dimensional input,

112
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,987
that would be f of x, y,

113
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:39,764
and what we're looking
at is the x y plane,

114
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:41,169
all of the input space,

115
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,783
and this output's just some number,

116
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:44,002
you know, maybe it's like x squared,

117
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:45,406
this particular one is an x squared,

118
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:46,406
but, you know that,

119
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:48,633
and maybe some complicated thing,

120
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:50,759
and the color tells you roughly the size

121
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,698
of that output, and the lines here,

122
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:54,207
called contour lines,

123
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:58,282
tell you which inputs all
share a constant output value.

124
00:03:58,282 --> 00:04:00,163
And again, I'll go into
much more detail there.

125
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:01,858
These are really nice,
much more convenient

126
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:03,117
than three-dimensional graphs,

127
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,819
to just sketch out.

128
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,826
Moving right along,

129
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:09,683
I'm also gonna talk about surfaces

130
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:10,705
in three-dimensional space.

131
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:11,819
They look like graphs,

132
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,125
but they actually deal with
a much different animal,

133
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,440
that you could think of it
as mapping two dimensions,

134
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,158
and I like to sort of spoosh it about.

135
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,504
And we've got kind of a
two-dimensional input,

136
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,965
that somehow moves into three dimensions,

137
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:24,660
and you're just looking at what the output

138
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,048
of that looks like,

139
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:28,264
not really caring about how it gets there.

140
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:31,022
These are called parametric surfaces.

141
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,147
Another fun one is a vector field,

142
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,504
where every input point is associated

143
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:36,642
with some kind of vector,

144
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,139
which is the output of the function there.

145
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:39,068
So this would be a function

146
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:40,287
with a two-dimensional input

147
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:41,820
and a two-dimensional output

148
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,724
'cause each of these are
two-dimensional vectors.

149
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:44,943
And the fun part with these guys

150
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:47,489
is that you can just kind of,

151
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:49,099
imagine a fluid flowing,

152
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,188
so here's a bunch of droplets, like water,

153
00:04:51,188 --> 00:04:52,779
and they kind of flow along that.

154
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,300
And that actually turns
out to give insight

155
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,821
about the underlying function.

156
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:57,389
It's one of those beautiful aspects

157
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:58,689
of multivariable calc.

158
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,361
And we'll get lots of exposure to that.

159
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,603
Again, I'm just sort of zipping through

160
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:02,787
to whet your appetite.

161
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:06,061
Don't worry if this doesn't
make sense immediately.

162
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:07,965
And one of my all-time
favorite ways to think about

163
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:11,321
multivariable functions is
to just take the input space,

164
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:14,118
in this case, this is gonna
be a function that inputs

165
00:05:14,118 --> 00:05:15,332
points in two-dimensional space,

166
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:17,520
and watch them move to their output,

167
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,622
so, this is gonna be a
function that also outputs

168
00:05:19,622 --> 00:05:20,539
in two dimensions.

169
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,106
And I'm just gonna
watch every single point

170
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:24,962
move over to where it's supposed to go.

171
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:27,064
These can be kind of
complicated to look at,

172
00:05:27,064 --> 00:05:28,178
or to think about at first,

173
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:30,198
but as you gain a little bit of thought

174
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:31,220
and exposure to them,

175
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,822
they're actually very nice,

176
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:34,889
and it provides a beautiful connection

177
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:36,224
with linear algebra.

178
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:37,280
A lot of you out there,

179
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,821
if you're studying multivariable calculus,

180
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,880
you either are about to
study linear algebra,

181
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,422
or you just have, or maybe
you're doing it concurrently,

182
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:45,767
but understanding functions
as transformations

183
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:47,846
is gonna be a great way
to connect those two.

184
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:48,867
So with that,

185
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:51,758
I'll stop jabbering through
these topics really quickly

186
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:53,941
and in the next few videos

187
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:55,543
I'll actually go through them in detail

188
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:57,366
and hopefully you can get a good feel

189
00:05:57,366 --> 00:06:00,581
for what multivariable functions
can actually feel like.
