00:00:01,048 --> 00:00:04,762
- [Voiceover] So I have here
a three-dimensional graph,

2
00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:05,999
and that means that it's representing

3
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:07,545
some kind of function that has

4
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:10,743
a two-dimensional input
and a one-dimension output.

5
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:14,326
So that might look
something like f of x, y

6
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:17,396
equals and then just some

7
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:20,359
expression that has a
bunch of x's and y's in it.

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,471
And graphs are great

9
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:23,471
but they're kinda clunky to draw.

10
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:25,395
I mean, certainly you can't
just scribble it down.

11
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:28,240
It typically requires some
kind of graphing software

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,702
and when you take a static image of it

13
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:31,792
it's not always clear what's going on.

14
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,743
So here I'm going to
describe a way that you can

15
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:37,144
represent these functions and
these graphs two-dimensionally

16
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:40,581
just by scribbling down on a
two-dimensional piece of paper.

17
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:43,156
This is a very common way
that you'll see if you're

18
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:46,085
reading a textbook or if someone
is drawing on a blackboard.

19
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:48,209
It's known as a contour plot

20
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:49,799
and the idea of a contour plot

21
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,132
is that we're going to take this graph

22
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:53,096
and slice it a bunch of times.

23
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:55,060
So I'm going to slice
it with various planes

24
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,903
that are all parallel to the x, y plane

25
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:00,169
and let's think for a moment

26
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:02,349
about what these guys represent.

27
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:04,650
So the bottom one here

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,650
represents the value z
is equal to negative two.

29
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,781
This is the z-axis over here

30
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,664
and when we fix that to be negative two

31
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:16,940
and let x and y run freely
we get this whole plane.

32
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,549
And if you let z increase,
keep it constant,

33
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,504
but let it increase by one to negative one

34
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:26,671
we get a new plane, still
parallel to the x, y plane

35
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:31,318
but it's distance from the
x, y plane is negative one.

36
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:32,173
And the rest of these guys,

37
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:35,829
they're all still constant values of z.

38
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,344
Now in terms of our graph,

39
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:39,268
what that means is that

40
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:44,175
these represent constant
values of the graph itself.

41
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:47,185
These represent constant
values for the function itself.

42
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:49,685
So because we always represent
the output of the function

43
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:52,122
as the height off of the x, y plane

44
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:56,039
these represent constant
values for the output.

45
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,650
What that's going to look like.

46
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,167
So what we do

47
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:05,751
is we say, "Where do these
slices cut into the graph?"

48
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,127
So I'm going to draw on all of the points

49
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,916
where those slices cut into the graph

50
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,889
and these are called contour lines.

51
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:12,957
We're still in three-dimensions

52
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:15,349
so we're not done yet.

53
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:18,017
So what I'm going to do is
take all these contour lines

54
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:21,456
and I'm going to squish them
down on to the x, y plane.

55
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:23,638
So what that means,

56
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:26,750
each of them has some kind
of z component at the moment,

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,632
and we're just going to chop it down,

58
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:31,132
squish them all nice and flat,

59
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:34,204
on to the x, y plane.

60
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,885
And now we have something two-dimensional,

61
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:38,069
and it still represents

62
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,614
some of the outputs of our function.

63
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,041
Not all of them, it's not perfect,

64
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,941
but it does give a very good idea.

65
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:46,745
I'm going to switch over to
a two-dimensional graph here.

66
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:48,845
And this is that same

67
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:51,162
function that we were just looking at.

68
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:55,042
Let's actually move it a
little bit more central here.

69
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,400
So this is the same function

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,150
that we were just looking at, but

71
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:01,546
each of these lines represents

72
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:03,490
a constant output of the function

73
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,802
so it's important to realize

74
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:07,208
we're still representing

75
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,665
a function that has a
two-dimensional input

76
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,051
and a one-dimensional output.

77
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,237
It's just that we're
looking in the input space

78
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,658
of that function as a whole.

79
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:16,663
So this is still

80
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,496
f of x, y

81
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:22,655
and then some expression of those guys

82
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:26,099
but this line might represent
the constant value of f

83
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,559
when all of the values
were at outputs three.

84
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,716
Over here, this also,

85
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:33,239
both of these circles together give you

86
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,771
all the values where f outputs three.

87
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,917
This one over here

88
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,355
will tell you where it outputs two

89
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:41,665
and you can't know this just
looking at the contour plot

90
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:43,459
so typically if someone's drawing it

91
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,185
if it matters that you
know the specific values

92
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,734
they'll mark it somehow.

93
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:51,357
They'll let you know what
value each line corresponds to

94
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,901
but as soon as you know that
this line corresponds to zero

95
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,432
it tells you that every
possible input point

96
00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:58,157
that sits somewhere on this line

97
00:03:58,157 --> 00:04:01,583
will evaluate to zero when you
pump it through the function.

98
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,049
And this actually gives a very good feel

99
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,759
for the shape of things.

100
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,474
If you like thinking in terms of graphs

101
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:08,049
you can kind of imagine how

102
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,107
these circles and everything
would pop out of the page.

103
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:11,940
You can also look,

104
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,659
notice how the lines are really
close together over here,

105
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,637
very, very close together,

106
00:04:15,637 --> 00:04:18,034
but they're a little
more spaced over here.

107
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:20,460
How do you interpret that?

108
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,977
Well, over here this means it
takes a very, very small step

109
00:04:24,977 --> 00:04:27,717
to increase the value
of the function by one,

110
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:29,865
very small step and it increases by one,

111
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:32,082
but over here it takes a much larger step

112
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:34,534
to increase the function
by the same value.

113
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:36,935
So over here this kind of means steepness.

114
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:40,328
If you see a very short
distance between contour lines

115
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:41,527
it's going to be very steep

116
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:44,181
but over here it's much more shallow.

117
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:46,311
And you can do things like this
to kind of get a better feel

118
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:47,885
for the function as whole.

119
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:49,846
The idea of a whole bunch
of concentric circles

120
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:53,689
usually corresponds to
a maximum or a minimum,

121
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,219
and you end up seeing these a lot.

122
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:57,219
Another common

123
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:59,603
thing people will do with contour plots

124
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:01,756
as they represent them is color them.

125
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:04,022
So what that might look like

126
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,636
is here where

127
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:09,142
warmer colors like orange
correspond to high values

128
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,329
and cooler colors like blue
correspond to low values.

129
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,869
The contour lines end up going along

130
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:17,908
the division between red and green here,

131
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:20,104
between light green and green,

132
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:21,740
and that's another way were

133
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,855
colors tell you the output and then

134
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:25,585
the contour lines
themselves can be thought of

135
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:28,755
as the borders between different colors.

136
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:30,169
And again a good way to get a feel

137
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:31,690
for a multi-dimensional function

138
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,607
just by looking at the input space.
