1
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:02,067
- [Voiceover] So a lot of the ways that we

2
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:04,041
represent multivariable functions

3
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:05,875
assume that you're
fluent with understanding

4
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:08,522
how to represent points
in three-dimensions

5
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:11,100
and also how to represent
vectors in three-dimensions.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,259
So I thought I'd make
a little video here to,

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,279
spell out exactly how
it is that we describe

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:17,369
points and vectors in three-dimensions.

9
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,646
And before we do that,

10
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:20,202
I think it will be valuable

11
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:22,036
if we start off by describing

12
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:24,753
points and vectors in two-dimensions.

13
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:26,495
And, I'm assuming if you're learning

14
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:27,632
about multivariable calculus,

15
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:29,351
that a lot of you have
already learned about this.

16
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:30,396
And you might be saying

17
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:31,417
what's the point?

18
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:32,926
I already know how to represent,

19
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:36,015
points and vectors in two-dimensions.

20
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,824
But there is a huge value in analogy here,

21
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:40,984
because as soon as you start to compare

22
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:42,911
two dimensions and three-dimensions,

23
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:46,115
you start to see patterns for how it could

24
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:47,996
extend to other dimensions that you

25
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,459
can't necessarily visualize,

26
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:51,433
or when it might be useful to think about

27
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:53,244
one dimension versus another.

28
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:55,914
So in two-dimensions, if
you have some kind of point

29
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:58,863
just, you know, off sitting there.

30
00:00:58,863 --> 00:00:59,931
We typically represent it,

31
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:01,998
you've got an x-axis and a y-axis

32
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:03,716
that a perpendicular to each other.

33
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:05,945
And we represent this number with a pair.

34
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:10,636
Sorry, we represent this
point with a pair of numbers.

35
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:11,936
So in this case, I don't know,

36
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,482
it might be something like one, three.

37
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:14,950
And what that would represent,

38
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,685
is it's saying that you
have to move a distance

39
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:19,185
of one along the x-axis

40
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:24,139
and then a distance of
three up along the y-axis.

41
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:26,809
So you know this, let's say
that's a distance of one,

42
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:27,947
that's a distance of three,

43
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:29,340
it might not be exactly
that the way I drew it,

44
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,359
but let's say that those
are the coordinates.

45
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,357
What this means is that every

46
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:35,772
point in two dimensional space

47
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:37,595
can be given a pair of numbers like this

48
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:38,907
and you think of them as instructions

49
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:39,929
where it's kind of telling you

50
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:41,159
how far to walk in one way,

51
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,017
how far to walk in another.

52
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:45,385
But you can also think
of the reverse, right?

53
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:47,754
Every time that you have a pair of things

54
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:50,726
you know that you should be
thinking two-dimensionaly

55
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:51,887
and that's actually,

56
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:53,536
a surprisingly powerful idea that

57
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,672
I don't think I
appreciated for a long time

58
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:57,599
how there's this back and forth between

59
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,317
pairs of numbers and points in space

60
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:01,291
and it lets you visualize things

61
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,661
you didn't think you could visualize,

62
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:03,497
or lets you understand things

63
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:04,774
that are inherently visual just by

64
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:06,562
kinda going back and forth.

65
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:08,025
And in three-two-dimensions

66
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:10,068
there's a similar dichotomy, but between

67
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:12,458
triplets of points and

68
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,898
points in three-dimensional space.

69
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:16,684
So, let me just plop down a point

70
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:18,751
in three-dimensional space here,

71
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:20,097
and it's hard to get a feel for exactly

72
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:22,396
where it is until you move things around.

73
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:24,300
This is one thing that
makes three-dimensions hard

74
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,158
is you can't really draw it without

75
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:27,946
moving it around or showing,

76
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:30,732
showing a difference in
perspective in various ways.

77
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:32,357
But we describe points like this,

78
00:02:32,357 --> 00:02:34,772
again with a set of coordinates,

79
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,700
but this time it's a triplet.

80
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,347
And this particular point,

81
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:43,447
I happen to know is one, two, five.

82
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:46,464
And what those numbers are telling you is

83
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,250
how far to move, parallel to each axis.

84
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,015
So just like with two dimensions,

85
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:52,780
we have an x-axis,

86
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,266
and a y-axis.

87
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,473
But now there's a third axis that's

88
00:02:55,473 --> 00:02:57,238
perpendicular to both of them,

89
00:02:57,238 --> 00:03:00,489
and moves us into that
third-dimension, the z-axis.

90
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,369
And the first number in our coordinate

91
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:04,204
is gonna tell us how far,

92
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:06,967
whoop, can't move those guys,

93
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,591
how far we need to move in the x direction

94
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:10,938
as our first step.

95
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:12,934
The second number, two in this case,

96
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:14,676
tells us how far we need to move

97
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:17,857
parallel to the y-axis,
for our second step.

98
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:20,365
And then the third number
tells us how far up

99
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:23,105
we have to go to get to that point.

100
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:24,591
And you can do this for any point

101
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,193
in three-dimensional space, right?

102
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:27,308
Any point that you have you can

103
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:28,747
give the instructions for how to move

104
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:30,942
along the x, and then how
to move parallel to the y

105
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,196
and how to move parallel to the z

106
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:33,473
to get to that point,

107
00:03:33,473 --> 00:03:35,609
which means there's this back and forth

108
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,604
between triplets of
numbers and points in 3-D.

109
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:40,648
So whenever you come
across a triplet of things,

110
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:41,728
and you'll see this in the next video

111
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:44,119
when we start talking about
three-dimensional graphs,

112
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,547
you'll know, just by virtue of the

113
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:46,407
fact that it's a triplet

114
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:49,379
"Ah, yes, I should be thinking
in three-dimensions somehow"

115
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,376
just in the same way
whenever you have pairs

116
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:52,258
you should be thinking

117
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:54,859
ah, this is a very two-dimensional thing.

118
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,879
So, there's another context though

119
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,037
where pairs of numbers come up

120
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:01,894
and that would be vectors.

121
00:04:01,894 --> 00:04:03,427
So a vector you might represent,

122
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:05,958
you know you typically it with an arrow.

123
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:06,840
Oh,

124
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,792
ahh.

125
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:11,125
Help, help! (chuckling)

126
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:15,234
So vectors,

127
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,890
So vectors we typically
represent some kind of arrow,

128
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,307
let's, this arrow nice color.

129
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,543
An arrow.

130
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:30,676
And if it's a vector from
the origin to a simple point,

131
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:33,904
the coordinates of that vector

132
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:35,668
are just the same as those of the point.

133
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:36,783
And the convention is to write

134
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:38,594
those coordinates in a column.

135
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:39,499
You know, it's not set in stone,

136
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:40,986
but typically if you
see numbers in a column

137
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:42,750
you should be thinking
about it as a vector,

138
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,818
some kind of arrow.

139
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,931
And if it's a pair with
parenthesis around it

140
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:47,835
you just think about it as a point.

141
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:49,484
And even though, you know, both of these

142
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:51,783
are ways of representing
the same pair of numbers,

143
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:53,896
the main difference is that a vector

144
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:55,661
you could have started
at any point in space

145
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:57,332
it didn't have to start in the origin.

146
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:58,772
So if we have that same guy,

147
00:04:58,772 --> 00:04:59,956
but you know if he starts here

148
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,953
and he still has a
rightward component of one

149
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:04,136
and an upward component of three,

150
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,040
we think of that as the same vector.

151
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,289
And typically these are
representing motion of some kind

152
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,984
whereas points are just representing

153
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:14,317
like actual points in space.

154
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:17,232
And the other big thing that you can do

155
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:18,881
is you can add vectors together.

156
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:20,877
So, you know, if you had another,

157
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:23,339
let's say you have another vector

158
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,662
that has a large x component

159
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:29,492
but a small negative y
component, like this guy.

160
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:31,489
And what that means is
that you can kind of add

161
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:33,881
like, imagining that second vector started

162
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:36,131
at the tip of the first one

163
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:39,825
and then however you get from the origin

164
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:41,172
to the new tip there,

165
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,633
that's gonna be the resulting vector, so

166
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:47,325
I'd say this is, this is the
sum of those two vectors.

167
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:49,415
And you can't really do
that with points as much.

168
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,040
In order to think about adding points

169
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,223
you end up thinking about them as vectors.

170
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:56,033
And the same goes with three-dimensions.

171
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:58,552
For a given point, if you draw an arrow

172
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:01,302
from the origin up to that point,

173
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:04,125
this arrow would be represented

174
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,890
with that same triplet of numbers,

175
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,676
but you typically do it in a column,

176
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:09,977
I call this a column vector.

177
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:12,477
That's not three, that's five.

178
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:14,888
And the difference between the point

179
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,745
and the arrow is you can think of,

180
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:18,463
you know the arrow or the vector

181
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:19,810
is starting anywhere in space,

182
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,716
it doesn't really matter,

183
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:23,131
as long as it's got those same components

184
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:24,965
for how far does it
move parallel to the x,

185
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:27,775
for how far does it move
parallel to the y-axis,

186
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:30,747
and for how far does it
move parallel to the z-axis.

187
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:32,001
So in the next video,

188
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,764
I'll show how we use
these three-dimensions

189
00:06:34,764 --> 00:06:37,963
to start graphing multivariable functions.
