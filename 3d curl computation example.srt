00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,417
- [Voiceover] So let's
go ahead and work through

2
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:03,275
an actual curl computation.

3
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:05,574
Let's say our vector valued function V,

4
00:00:05,574 --> 00:00:07,013
which is a function of X, Y, and Z,

5
00:00:07,013 --> 00:00:08,848
this is gonna be three-dimensional,

6
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:11,309
is defined by the functions, I don't know,

7
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,979
let's say the first
component is X times Y.

8
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:15,893
The second one is

9
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:16,893
cosine of Z,

10
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:23,223
and then the last component
is Z squared plus Y.

11
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:25,655
Let's say.

12
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:27,280
So if you take this guy,

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,530
how do you compute the curl

14
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:33,817
of that vector valued function?

15
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:35,767
So what you do, as I
mentioned in the last video,

16
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:38,693
is you imagine taking this del operator

17
00:00:38,693 --> 00:00:40,853
and taking the cross product between that

18
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:42,501
and your vector valued function.

19
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,405
And what that means when you expand it

20
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,867
is that del operator,
you just kinda fill it

21
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:49,514
with partial differential
operators, you could say,

22
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:51,511
but really it's just the
symbol partial partial X,

23
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,011
partial partial Y,

24
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:56,446
partial partial Z.

25
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:57,979
And these are things that are just waiting

26
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:59,628
to take in some kind of function.

27
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:01,810
So we're gonna take the
cross product between that

28
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,109
and the function that
we have defined here.

29
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:07,442
So I'm gonna just actually copy it over,

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,460
copy it over here.

31
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:14,288
And a little residue.

32
00:01:14,288 --> 00:01:16,030
And to compute this cross product,

33
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,003
we take a certain determinant.

34
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:20,070
So I'm gonna write over here determinant,

35
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,160
and it's gonna be of a
three-by-three matrix,

36
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,412
but really it's kinda like
a quote-unquote matrix,

37
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:26,572
because each component
has something funky.

38
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:28,192
So the top row, just like we would have

39
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:30,746
with any other cross
product that we're computing

40
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:33,625
is gonna have i, j, and
k, these unit vectors

41
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,135
in three-dimensional space.

42
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:36,504
And the second row here is gonna have

43
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:38,548
all of these partial
differential operators,

44
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:41,381
since that's the first
vector in our cross product.

45
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:43,714
So that's partial partial X,

46
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,009
partial partial Y,

47
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,565
and again, all of these are just kind of

48
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,027
waiting to be given a function

49
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,558
that they can take the derivative of.

50
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:53,789
And then that third row is gonna be

51
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,950
the functions that we have.

52
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,783
So the first component here is XY,

53
00:01:59,107 --> 00:02:02,032
the second component is cosine of Z,

54
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:03,032
cosine of Z,

55
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,930
and then that final component
is Z squared plus Y.

56
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,763
Z squared

57
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:10,786
plus Y.

58
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:12,226
Now let's all get some room here,

59
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:14,524
maybe make it more visible.

60
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,664
So this is the determinant
we need to compute.

61
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:19,233
And this is gonna be broken
up into three different parts.

62
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:20,933
The first one,

63
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,016
we take this top part, i,

64
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:28,371
and multiply it by the
determinant of this sub-matrix.

65
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:31,319
So when we do that, this sub-determinant,

66
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,781
we're taking partial
derivative with respect to Y

67
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,638
of Z squared plus Y.

68
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,101
Now as far as Y is concerned,

69
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:38,239
Z looks like a constant.

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,818
So Z squared is a constant,

71
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:42,813
and the partial derivative of
this entire guy is just one.

72
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:45,019
So that'll look like one.

73
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,202
And then we're subtracting
off the partial derivative

74
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:49,779
with respect to Z of cosine of Z,

75
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:52,124
and that just looks the
same as a derivative

76
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:54,725
of cosine Z, which is negative sine,

77
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:57,381
so that's negative sine

78
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:58,214
of Z.

79
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,932
So that's the first part.

80
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,463
And then as the next
part, we're gonna take j,

81
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:06,739
but we're subtracting, 'cause
you're always kinda thinking

82
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:10,454
plus, minus, plus, when you're
doing these determinants.

83
00:03:10,454 --> 00:03:13,171
So we're gonna subtract off j,

84
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:15,307
multiplied by its own
little sub-determinant,

85
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:18,140
and this time the
sub-determinant is gonna involve

86
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,462
the two columns that it's not part of.

87
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:21,832
So you're imagining this first column

88
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:24,177
and this second column as
being part of a matrix.

89
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:25,942
So the first thing you do is you take

90
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:27,846
this partial derivative with respect to X

91
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,309
of Z squared plus Y.

92
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,516
Well no Xs show up there, right?

93
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:31,909
That's Z squared and Y.

94
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:34,742
Each look like constants
as far as X is concerned.

95
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:35,992
So that's zero.

96
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,061
Then we take the partial with respect to Z

97
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:40,454
of X times Y.

98
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,196
And again, there's no
Z that shows up there,

99
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:46,677
so that's also zero, so we're
kinda subtracting off zero.

100
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:49,556
And then finally, we're
adding this last component.

101
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:52,575
We're gonna add that last component, k,

102
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:55,454
multiplied by the determinant
of this sub-matrix

103
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:57,474
of the columns that it's not part of.

104
00:03:57,474 --> 00:03:58,798
So this involves partial derivative

105
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:01,497
with respect to X of cosine Z.

106
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:04,748
Well no Xs show up there,
so that's just zero.

107
00:04:04,748 --> 00:04:06,583
So that's just a zero.

108
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,301
And then we're subtracting off the partial

109
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:11,064
with respect to Y of X times Y.

110
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:13,456
Well X looks like a constant,
Y looks like the variable,

111
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:15,870
so that partial derivative is just X.

112
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,120
So we're subtracting off X.

113
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:21,885
Which means if we simplify this,

114
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:24,671
so the curl of our vector field,

115
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,922
curl of our vector field as a whole,

116
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:30,589
as this function of X, Y, and Z,

117
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:33,285
is equal to,

118
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,886
and that first component, the i component,

119
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:38,138
we've got one minus negative sine of Z,

120
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:39,903
so minus minus sine of Z.

121
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,153
That's one plus

122
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:43,555
sine of Z.

123
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:47,505
And then the j component,
we're subtracting off,

124
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:48,852
but it's zero.

125
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:49,952
Usually if you're subtracting off,

126
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:51,926
you'd have to make sure
to remember to flip those,

127
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:55,107
but both of those are zero, so
the entire j component here,

128
00:04:55,107 --> 00:04:58,218
or the Y component of the output, is zero.

129
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:02,385
And then finally, the k
component is zero minus X,

130
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:06,938
so that entire thing is just negative X.

131
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:09,759
And that's the curl of the function.

132
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,245
And in general, that's how you do it.

133
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,938
You would take a look at the way

134
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,562
that your function is defined
in each component there,

135
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:18,095
and imaging taking the cross product

136
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:21,508
between this del symbol,
this partial partial X,

137
00:05:21,508 --> 00:05:23,412
partial partial Y, partial partial Z,

138
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:24,420
and you take the cross product

139
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,184
between that and your function,

140
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:29,389
and it involves taking six
different partial derivatives.

141
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,525
And mainly it's a matter of bookkeeping

142
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:32,895
to make sure you do it right.

143
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:34,828
And you'll end up with
something like this.
