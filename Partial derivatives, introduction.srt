1
00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:01,110
- [Voiceover] So, let's say I have

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,129
some multi-variable function like F of XY.

3
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,428
So, they'll have a two variable input,

4
00:00:06,428 --> 00:00:08,065
is equal to, I don't know,

5
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:11,663
X squared times Y, plus sin(Y).

6
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:13,125
So, allow for just a single number.

7
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,994
It's a scalar valued function.

8
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:16,770
Question is, how do we take the derivative

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,733
of an expression like this?

10
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:21,089
And there's a certain method
called a partial derivative,

11
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,017
which is very similar
to ordinary derivatives

12
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:24,677
and I kinda wanna show
how they're secretly

13
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:25,815
the same thing.

14
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:27,951
So, to do that, let me
just remind ourselves

15
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:32,050
of how we interpret the notation
for ordinary derivatives.

16
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,579
So, if you have something
like F(X)=X squared,

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,075
and let's say you wanna
take its derivative,

18
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:41,547
and I'll use the Leibniz notation here, df/dx,

19
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:44,712
and let's evaluate it at two, let's say.

20
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,593
I really like this notation
because it's suggestive

21
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:47,591
of what's going on.

22
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:49,674
If we sketch out a graph,

23
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:54,975
so this axis represents our output,

24
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:56,752
this over here represents our input,

25
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:59,549
and X squared has a certain
parabolic shape to it.

26
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:01,036
Something like that.

27
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:05,552
Then we go to the input,
x equals one, two.

28
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:07,932
This little DX here, I like to interpret

29
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:10,589
as just a little nudge in the X direction.

30
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:12,666
And it's kind of the size of that nudge.

31
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,666
And then DF,

32
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:18,212
is the resulting change in the output

33
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,254
after you make that initial little nudge.

34
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:22,658
So, it's this resulting change.

35
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:23,954
And when you're thinking
n terms of graphs,

36
00:01:23,954 --> 00:01:24,787
this is slope.

37
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:26,640
You kind of have this rise over run

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,161
for your ratio between the tiny change

39
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:31,122
of the output that's caused
by a tiny change in the input.

40
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:33,466
And of course, this is
dependent on where you start.

41
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:35,766
Over here we have X=2.

42
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:37,804
But, you could also think
about this without graphs

43
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:39,243
if you really wanted to.

44
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:41,124
You might just think about,

45
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:43,563
your input space as just a number line

46
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:47,730
and your output space,
also as just a number line,

47
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,285
the output of F over here.

48
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:53,083
And really, you're just thinking
of somehow mapping numbers

49
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,439
from here onto the second line.

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,925
And in that case, your initial nudge,

51
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:59,190
your initial little DX,

52
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,883
would be some nudge on that number line.

53
00:02:01,883 --> 00:02:02,905
And you're wondering how

54
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,142
that influences the function itself.

55
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:08,357
So maybe that causes a nudge
that's four times as big

56
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:13,188
and that would mean your
derivative is four at that point.

57
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:15,000
So, the reason I'm talking about this is

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,822
because over in the multi-variable world,

59
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:19,905
we can pretty much do the same thing.

60
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,423
You can write df/dx and
interpret that as saying,

61
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:29,510
hey how does a tiny change in
the input in the X direction

62
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,577
influence the output.

63
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:33,457
But, this time, the way
that you might visualize it,

64
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,141
you'd be thinking of your input space.

65
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:38,380
Here, I'll draw it down
here, as the XY plane.

66
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,157
So, this time, this is not
gonna be graphing the function,

67
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:43,512
this is, every point on
the plane is an input.

68
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:45,104
And let's say you were evaluating this

69
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:47,187
at a point like one, two.

70
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:53,118
In that case, you'd go over
to the input that's one

71
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:56,079
and then two, and then you'd say, okay,

72
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,797
so this tiny nudge in the input,

73
00:02:57,797 --> 00:03:01,964
this tiny change DX, how does
that influence the output.

74
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:04,380
And in this case the output, I mean,

75
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,526
it's still just a number.

76
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:08,057
So maybe we go off to the side here

77
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:12,446
and we draw just like a
number line as our output.

78
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:14,548
And somehow we're thinking
about the function

79
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:17,137
as mapping points on the
plane to the number line.

80
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:19,076
So you'd say, okay, that's your DX,

81
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:21,177
how much does it change the output?

82
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:23,394
And, maybe this time it
changes it negatively.

83
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:25,066
It depends on your function.

84
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,715
And that would be your DF.

85
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,874
And you can also do this
with the Y variable, right.

86
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:32,541
There's no reason that
you can't say DF, DY,

87
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:37,834
and evaluate at that same point, one, two.

88
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:40,457
And interpret totally the same way.

89
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:43,394
Except, this time your DY would be

90
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:46,355
a change in the Y direction.

91
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:48,421
So maybe I should really
emphasize here that

92
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:52,822
that DX is a change in
the X direction here

93
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:54,866
and that DY is a change
in the Y direction.

94
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:57,721
And maybe, when you change
your F according to Y,

95
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:58,801
it does something different.

96
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:02,851
Maybe, the output increases
and it increases by a lot,

97
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,128
it's more sensitive to Y.

98
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:06,401
Again, it depends on the function.

99
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,625
And I'll show you how you can
compute something like this

100
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,065
in just a moment here.

101
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:12,340
But, first there's kind of
an annoying thing associated

102
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,605
with partial derivatives,
where we don't write them

103
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:17,228
with D's in DX/DF.

104
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,293
People came up with this new notation,

105
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,835
mostly just to emphasize to the reader

106
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,075
of your equation that it's

107
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:25,119
a multi-variable function involved.

108
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:28,579
And what you do, is
you say, you write a D,

109
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:30,680
but it's got kind of a curl at the top.

110
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,072
It's this new symbol and
people will often read it

111
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,279
as partial.

112
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,589
So, you might read like
partial F, partial Y.

113
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:37,710
If you're wondering, by the way,

114
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,213
why we call these partial derivatives,

115
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,350
it's sort of like, this
doesn't tell the full story

116
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,112
of how F changes 'cause it only
cares about the X direction.

117
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:46,794
Neither does this, this only
cares about the Y direction.

118
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:50,997
So, each one is only a
small part of the story.

119
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:53,749
So, let's actually evaluate
something like this.

120
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:56,071
I'm gonna go ahead and
clear the board over here.

121
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:58,988
I think the one-dimensional analogy

122
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:03,104
is something we probably have already.

123
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,600
So, little remnants.

124
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:10,690
So, if you're actually
evaluating something like this,

125
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,240
here, I'll write it up here again up here.

126
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,607
Partial derivative of
F, with respect to X,

127
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,046
and we're doing it at one, two.

128
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:19,926
It only cares about
movement in the X direction,

129
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:21,540
so it's treating Y as a constant.

130
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,501
It doesn't even care about
the fact that Y changes.

131
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,264
As far as it's concerned,
Y is always equal to two.

132
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:28,947
So, we can just plug
that in ahead of time.

133
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:31,025
So, I'm gonna say partial, partial X,

134
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,198
this is another way you might write it,

135
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,800
put the expression in here.

136
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,646
And I'll say X squared,
but instead of writing Y,

137
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:40,018
I'm just gonna plug in that
constant ahead of time.

138
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:42,050
'Cause when you're only
moving in the X direction,

139
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,207
this is kind of how the
multi-variable function

140
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:46,380
sees the world.

141
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,529
And I'll just keep a little note

142
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:51,685
that we're evaluating this
whole thing at X equals one.

143
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,845
And here, this is actually
just an ordinary derivative.

144
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:55,842
This is an expression that's an X,

145
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:57,642
you're asking how it changes

146
00:05:57,642 --> 00:06:00,010
as you shift around X and
you know how to do this.

147
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,830
This is just taking the derivative

148
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,697
of X square times two

149
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:09,794
is gonna be 4x 'cause
X squared goes to 2x.

150
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:11,281
And then the derivative of a constant,

151
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:15,146
sin of two is just a constant, is zero.

152
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:17,520
And of course we're evaluating
this at X equals one,

153
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,791
so your overall answer is gonna be four.

154
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,033
And as for practice, let's also do

155
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,111
that with derivative with respect to Y.

156
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:27,385
So, we look over here, I'm
gonna write the same thing.

157
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:29,254
You're taking the partial derivative of F

158
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:31,391
with respect to Y.

159
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,073
We're evaluating it at
the same point one, two.

160
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:39,024
This time it doesn't care about
movement in the X direction.

161
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,676
So, as far as it's concerned,

162
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:43,021
that X just stays constant at one.

163
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:47,188
So, we'd write one squared
times Y, plus sin(Y).

164
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:51,270
Sin(Y).

165
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,103
And you're saying, oh,

166
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:55,492
I'm keeping track of this at Y=2.

167
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:58,094
So, it's kind of, you're
evaluating at Y=2.

168
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:01,275
When you take the
derivative, this is just 1xY.

169
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,399
So the derivative is one.

170
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,566
This over here, the
derivative is cosine, cos(Y).

171
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:14,347
Again, we're evaluating
this whole thing at Y=2.

172
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:15,567
So, you're overall answer,

173
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:18,126
it would be 1+cos(2).

174
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:20,575
I'm not sure what the value of cos(2) is

175
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,597
off the top of my head,

176
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:23,443
but that would be your answer.

177
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,401
And, this is a partial
derivative at a point,

178
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:29,946
but a lot of times, you're
not asked to just compute it

179
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:31,894
at a point, what you
want is a general formula

180
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:34,421
that tells you, hey, plug in any point XY

181
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,477
and it should spit out the answer.

182
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:39,217
So, let me just kinda go
over how you would do that.

183
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,564
It's actually very similar,

184
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:42,537
but this time, instead of
plugging in the constant

185
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:44,360
ahead of time, we just have to pretend

186
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,544
that it's a constant.

187
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:49,711
So let me make a little bit
of space for ourselves here.

188
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:56,189
We don't need any of this anymore.

189
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:00,356
I'm gonna leave the partial
partial F, partial partial Y.

190
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:05,545
We want this as a more
general function of X and Y.

191
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:11,664
Well we kind of do the same thing.

192
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:13,290
We're gonna say that this is derivative

193
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,334
with respect to X,

194
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:16,389
and I'm using partials
just to kind of emphasize

195
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:18,293
that it's a partial derivative.

196
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,011
And now, we'd write X squared

197
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:24,923
and then kind of emphasize that
it's a constant value of Y,

198
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:28,463
plus the sin, and again,

199
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:29,508
I'll say Y.

200
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:33,281
And here, I'm writing the variable Y,

201
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:34,999
but we have to pretend
like it's a constant,

202
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,644
you're pretending that you plugin two

203
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:37,583
or something like that.

204
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,324
And you still just take the derivative.

205
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:40,485
So, in this case,

206
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,587
the derivative of X
squared times a constant,

207
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:45,170
is just 2x times that constant.

208
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:50,407
And over here, the derivative
of a constant is always zero.

209
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:52,427
So that's just always gonna be zero.

210
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:54,029
So, this is your partial derivative

211
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,736
as a more general formula.

212
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:56,637
If you plugged in one,

213
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,075
two to this, you'd get what we had before.

214
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:00,468
And similarly, if you're doing this

215
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:02,551
with partial F partial Y,

216
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,131
we write down all of the same things,

217
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,534
now you're taking it with respect to Y.

218
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:14,701
And I'm just gonna copy
this formula here actually.

219
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,035
But this time, we're considering all

220
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:26,857
of the the X's to be constants.

221
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,356
So, in this case, when
you take the derivative

222
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:29,911
with respect to Y of
some kind of constant,

223
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,909
constant squared is a constant,

224
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:35,751
times Y, it's just gonna
equal that constant.

225
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,632
So, this is gonna be X squared.

226
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:40,174
And over here, you're taking
the derivative of sin(Y).

227
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:44,341
There's no X's in there,
so that remains the sin(Y).

228
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:48,387
Now this is a more general formula.

229
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,430
If you plugged in one,
two, you would get one.

230
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,776
I'm sorry that's cos(y).

231
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:57,943
Cos(y) because we're taking a derivative.

232
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,062
So, if you plugged in one, two,

233
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,245
you would get 1+cos(1),

234
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:04,603
which is what we had before.

235
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,705
So this, this is really what you'll see

236
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,829
for how to compute a partial derivative.

237
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:10,965
You pretend that one of
the variables is constant

238
00:10:10,965 --> 00:10:12,544
and you take an ordinary derivative.

239
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:13,437
And in the back of your mind,

240
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:14,270
you're thinking this is

241
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,484
because you're just
moving in one direction

242
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:19,270
for the input and you're seeing
how that influences things.

243
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,510
And then, you might move in
one direction for another input

244
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,309
and see how that influences things.

245
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:26,248
In the next video, I'll
show you what this means

246
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:27,862
in terms of graphs and slopes,

247
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:30,788
but it's important to understand
that graphs and slopes

248
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:33,226
are not the only way to
understand derivatives

249
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:34,609
because as soon as you start thinking

250
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,513
about vector valued functions

251
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:39,717
or functions with inputs of
higher dimensions than just two,

252
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,992
you can no longer think
in terms of graphs.

253
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:44,350
But, this idea of nudging
the input in some direction,

254
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,579
seeing how that influences the output,

255
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,690
and then taking the ratio
of that output nudge

256
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,587
to the input nudge,

257
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:52,305
that's a more general
way of viewing things.

258
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:54,477
And that's gonna be very
helpful moving forward

259
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:55,310
in multi-variable calc.
