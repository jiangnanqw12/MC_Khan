1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,319
if we're just dealing with two

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,080
dimensions and we want to find the area

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,000
under curve we have

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
good tools in our toolkit all ready to

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,120
do it and i'll just remind us of our

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,400
tools so let's say that's x axis that's

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,000
the y-axis let me draw some arbitrary

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,720
function right here

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,199
that's my function f of x and let's say

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,400
we want to find the area

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,119
between x is equal to a so that's x

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,920
equal to a and x is equal to

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,280
b we saw this many many many videos ago

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,760
that the way you can think about is you

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,239
take super small widths of x or super

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,160
small changes in x we could call them

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,239
delta x's but because they're so small

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,920
we're going to call them a dx

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,399
we're going to call them a dx super

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
infinitesimally small changes in x and

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,960
then you multiply them times the value

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,640
of f of x at that point so you multiply

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,360
it times the height at that point which

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,640
is the value of f of x so you get f of x

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,000
times each of these infinite

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,040
infinitesimally small bases that'll give

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you the area of this infinitesimally

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,159
narrow

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
rectangle right there and since each of

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,439
these guys are infinitely small you're

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,119
going to have an infinite number of

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,960
these rectangles in order to fill the

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,400
space you're going to have an infinite

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,200
number of these

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,200
right and so the tool we used was the

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,000
definite integral the definite integral

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,600
is a sum it's an infinite sum of these

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
infinitely small

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
areas or these infinitely small

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,960
rectangles and the notations that we use

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,680
would say we go from a

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,360
to b and we've done many videos on how

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,040
do you evaluate these things but i just

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,040
want to remind you conceptually what

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,920
this is saying this is conceptually

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,680
saying let's take a small change in x

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,680
multiply it times the height at that

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
point so small change in x multiply it

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,479
times the height at that point and

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,159
you're going to have an infinite number

51
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,840
of these because these x's are super

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,119
small they're infinitely small so you're

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,960
going to have infinite number of those

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,520
so take an infinite sum of all of those

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,360
from x is equal to a to x is equal to b

56
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,880
and that's just our standard definite

57
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,360
integral now what i want to do in this

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,040
video is extend this broaden this a

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,880
little bit to solve a

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
i guess maybe you could say a harder or

61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
a broader class of problems

62
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
let's say

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,080
let's say that we are let's go to three

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
dimensions now and i'll just draw the x

65
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,800
y plane first maybe i'll keep this just

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,480
to kind of make the analogy clear

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,319
so let me draw i'm going to kind of

68
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,000
flatten this so we have some perspective

69
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,520
so let's say that this right here is the

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,040
y-axis kind of going behind the screen

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
as you can imagine if i just pushed on

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,760
this and knocked it down so that's the

73
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,000
y-axis and that is my x-axis right there

74
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,040
that is my x-axis and let's say i have

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,200
some path in the x-y plane

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,120
so and in order to really define a path

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,920
and the x-y plane i'll have to

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,239
parametrize or parameterize i have

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,400
trouble saying that both the x and y

80
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,400
variables so let's say that x

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,080
let's say that x is equal to let me

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,280
switch colors i'm using that orange too

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
much

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,879
let's say that x

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,840
is equal to

86
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,360
some function of some parameter t and

87
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,400
let's say y

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,480
is equal to some other function of that

89
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
same parameter t and let's say we're

90
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,280
going to start we're going to have t go

91
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,360
from

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,720
t is going to be greater than or equal

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,519
to a and then less than or equal to b

94
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,840
now this will define a path in the x y

95
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840
plane and if you if this seems confusing

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,000
you might want to review the videos on

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,480
parametric equations but essentially you

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,159
know when t is equal to a when t is

99
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,879
equal to a you know you're going to have

100
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,599
x is equal to so at t is equal to a

101
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,879
you're going to have x is equal to

102
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,720
g of a

103
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,280
and you're going to have y

104
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,720
is equal to h of a

105
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
so you're going to have this point right

106
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,480
here so maybe it might be i don't know

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,040
i'll just draw an ordinary random point

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,319
here maybe that's when t is equal to a

109
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,720
you're going to have you're going to

110
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,720
plot the coordinate point g of a that's

111
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,640
going to be our x coordinate this is g

112
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,200
of a right here and then our y

113
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,959
coordinate is going to be h of a

114
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,239
right you just put t is equal to a in

115
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,319
each of these equations and then you get

116
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,879
a value for x and y so this coordinate

117
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,799
right here would be h of a and then you

118
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,159
would keep incrementing t larger and

119
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,599
larger until you get to b but you're

120
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,280
going to get a series of points that are

121
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,199
going to look something like

122
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
let's say it looks something like that

123
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,120
that right there is a curve or it's a

124
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,479
path in the x y plane and you know what

125
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,840
you're saying how does that relate to

126
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,199
that right now you know what are we

127
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,720
doing well let me just write a c here

128
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,759
for saying that's our curve or that's

129
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
our path

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,040
now let's say i have another function

131
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,520
that associates every point in the x y

132
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,960
plane with some value so let's say i

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,479
have some function f of x y

134
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,919
f of x y

135
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,000
what it does is it associates every

136
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,639
point on the x y plane with some values

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
so let me plot x f of x y so let me

138
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,360
make a vertical axis here we could do a

139
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,520
different color

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,919
call it the f of x y axis maybe we could

141
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,160
even call it the z axis if you want to

142
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,880
but it's some vertical axis right there

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,520
and for every point so if you give me an

144
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,039
x and a y and you put into my f of x y

145
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,680
function it's going to give you some

146
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,000
point so let me so i can just draw some

147
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,440
type of a surface that f of x y

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,039
represents and this will always become a

149
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,199
lot more concrete when i do some

150
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,960
concrete examples so say let's say that

151
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,120
f x y looks something like this i'm

152
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,280
going to try my best to draw it let's

153
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,600
i'll do a different color

154
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,120
let's say f of x y you know some surface

155
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
i'll draw a part of it

156
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,120
it's some surface that looks let's say

157
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,000
it looks something like that

158
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,639
that is f of x y

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,280
f of x y and remember all this is is you

160
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,440
give me an x and you give me a y you pop

161
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,880
it into f of x y it's going to give me

162
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,720
some third value that we're going to

163
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,639
plot in this vertical axis right here i

164
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,320
mean examples f x y

165
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
it could be i'm not saying this is a

166
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,560
particular case it could be x plus y

167
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,080
it could be f of x y these are just

168
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,759
examples it could be

169
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,080
x times y if x is 1 y is 2 f of x y will

170
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,720
be 1 times 2. but let's say when you

171
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,960
plot for every point on the on on the x

172
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
y plane when you plot f x y you get this

173
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,280
surface up here and we want to do

174
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,000
something interesting we want to figure

175
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,520
out not the area under this curve this

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,800
was very simple when we did it the first

177
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,120
time i want to find the area

178
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,440
the area if you imagine a curtain or a

179
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,120
fence that goes along this this curve

180
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
that we this pat you can imagine this

181
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,840
being a very straight linear path going

182
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,759
just along the x-axis from a to b now we

183
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,240
have this kind of crazy curvy path

184
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,919
that's going along the x-y plane and you

185
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,680
can imagine if you drew a wall or

186
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,680
curtain or a fence that went straight up

187
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,319
from this to

188
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,840
my f of x y so let me do my best effort

189
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,600
to draw that

190
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,440
so let me draw it so it's going to go up

191
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,759
to there and maybe this point

192
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,360
corresponds to there and when you draw

193
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,080
that curtain up it's going to intersect

194
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,160
it

195
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,840
something like that let's say it looks

196
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,280
something like that so this point right

197
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,520
here

198
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,960
corresponds to that point

199
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,759
right there so if you imagine you have a

200
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,759
curtain you could f x y is the roof and

201
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,440
this is a what i've drawn here this

202
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,319
curve this kind of shows you the bottom

203
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,120
of a of a of a wall this is some kind of

204
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,720
crazy wall and let me say this point it

205
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,479
corresponds to

206
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,479
well actually let me let me draw a

207
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,639
little bit different i want to draw

208
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,639
this point will correspond to some point

209
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,400
up here so when you when you trace where

210
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,800
it intersects it'll look something like

211
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,280
maybe like that i don't know something

212
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,120
like that and i'm trying my best to help

213
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,639
you visualize this

214
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
so this side you know maybe i'll shade

215
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,240
this in to make it a little solid

216
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,759
let's say f of x y is a little

217
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,240
transparent you can see but then you

218
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,240
have this curvy looking wall here

219
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,759
and the whole point of this video is how

220
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,240
can we figure out the area of this curvy

221
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,479
looking wall right this curvy looking

222
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,160
wall that's essentially the wall or the

223
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,879
fence that happens if you go from this

224
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,960
curve and jump up and hit the ceiling at

225
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,039
this f of x y so let's think a little

226
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,520
bit about how we can do it well if we

227
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,879
just use the analogy of what we did

228
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,680
previously we could say well look you

229
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,680
know

230
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,759
this let's call this

231
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,360
you know let's call let's make a little

232
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,199
change in distance

233
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,520
of our of our curve let's call that ds

234
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,000
ds that's a little change in distance of

235
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,680
my curve right there and if i multiply

236
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,479
that change in distance of the curve

237
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,120
times f of x y at that point

238
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,599
times f of x y that point

239
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,080
i'm going to get the area i am going to

240
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,399
get the area of that little rectangle

241
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,760
right there right so if i take ds my

242
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,599
change in my

243
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,360
you can imagine the arc length of this

244
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,159
curve at that point

245
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,760
so let me write you know ds is equal to

246
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,279
super small

247
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,120
super

248
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,720
small

249
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,839
change

250
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,680
change

251
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,399
in arc length

252
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,120
in arc length of of our path or of our

253
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,279
curve that's our ds so you can imagine

254
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,080
the area of that little rectangle right

255
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,600
there along my curvy wall is going to be

256
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
ds

257
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
d i'll make it a capital s

258
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,040
d s

259
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,600
times the height at that point well

260
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,080
that's f of x y

261
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,680
f of x y and then if i take the sum

262
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360
because these are infinitely narrow

263
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,279
these d s's are infinitely they have

264
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,399
infinitely small width if i were to take

265
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,080
the infinite sum of all of those guys

266
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,440
from t is equal to a

267
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,279
to t is equal to b right from t is equal

268
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,360
to a i keep taking the sum of those

269
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,000
rectangles to t is equal to b right

270
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,839
there that will give me my area you know

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,959
i'm just using the exact same logic as i

272
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,880
did up there i'm not being very

273
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,320
mathematically rigorous but i want to

274
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,800
give you the intuition of what we're

275
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,040
doing we're really kind of just bending

276
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,279
the base of this thing to get a curvy

277
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,640
wall instead of a straight direct wall

278
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,800
like we had up here but you're saying

279
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,560
sal you know this is all abstract and

280
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,560
how can i even calculate something like

281
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,200
this this makes no sense to me i have an

282
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,120
s here i have an x and a y i have a t

283
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,040
what can i do with this and that's let's

284
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,240
see if we can make some headway and i

285
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,240
promise you when we do it with a

286
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,079
tangible problem the end product of this

287
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,519
video is going to be a little bit

288
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,440
hairy to look at

289
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,440
but when we do it with an actual problem

290
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,200
it'll actually i think make be very

291
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,399
concrete and you'll see it's not too

292
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,839
hard to deal with but let's see if we

293
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,760
can get all of this in terms of t so

294
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,279
first of all let's let's focus just on

295
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,880
this ds

296
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,040
so let me re-pick up the x-y-axis

297
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,560
so if i were to re-flip the x-y let me

298
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,160
switch colors it's just getting a little

299
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,640
monotonous

300
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,160
so if i were to re-flip the x-y-axis

301
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,440
like that i'm actually doing that same

302
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,839
green so you know we're dealing with the

303
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,160
same x y axis

304
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,519
so that's my y-axis

305
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,120
that is my x-axis and so this path right

306
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,720
here if i were to just draw it you know

307
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
straight up like this

308
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,959
it would look something like this it

309
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,079
would look something like this

310
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,399
right that's my path my my arc you know

311
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,000
this is when t is equal to a so this is

312
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,600
t is equal to a this is t is equal to b

313
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,760
same thing i just kind of picked it back

314
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,760
up so we can visualize it and we say

315
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,760
that we have some

316
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,360
change in arc length let's say this this

317
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,040
let me switch colors let's say that this

318
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,800
one right here

319
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,600
let's say that's some small change in

320
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,640
arc length and we're calling that d s

321
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,600
now is there some way to relate d s to

322
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,279
infinitely small changes in x or y

323
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,200
well if we think about it if we really

324
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,480
if we and this is all a little bit hand

325
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,839
wavy i'm not being mathematically

326
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
rigorous but i think it'll give you the

327
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,760
correct intuition

328
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,920
if you imagine this is you can figure

329
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,519
out the length of ds if you know the

330
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,720
lengths of the super small changes in x

331
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,240
and super small changes in y

332
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
so if this if this distance right here

333
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,640
is dx infinitesimally small change in x

334
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,279
this distance right here is d y

335
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,600
infinitesimally small change in y

336
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,839
right then we can figure out d s from

337
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,360
the pythagorean theorem you can say that

338
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
d s

339
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,760
d s is going to be it's the hypotenuse

340
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,120
of this triangle it's equal to the

341
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
square root

342
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,320
of

343
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,600
d x squared

344
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,760
plus

345
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,040
plus d y

346
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,880
plus d y squared so that seems to make

347
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,880
to make things a little bit you know we

348
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,639
can get rid of the ds all of a sudden so

349
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,480
let's rewrite this little expression

350
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,000
here using this sense of what ds ds is

351
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,079
really the square root of dx squared

352
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,440
plus dy squared and i'm not being very

353
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,639
rigorous and actually it's very hard to

354
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,160
be rigorous with differentials but

355
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,959
intuitively i think it makes a lot of

356
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,040
sense

357
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,839
so we can say that this integral the

358
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,800
area of this curvy curtain is going to

359
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,440
be the integral from t is equal to a

360
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,320
to t is equal to b

361
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,000
of

362
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,639
f of

363
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,680
x y instead of writing d s we can write

364
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:52,000
this times the square root

365
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,839
the square root of d x squared plus d y

366
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
squared now we at least got rid of this

367
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,200
big capital s but we still haven't

368
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,800
solved the problem of how do we solve

369
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,920
something you know an integral a

370
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
definite integral that looks like this

371
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,000
we have it in terms of t here but we

372
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,360
only have it in terms of x's and y's

373
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,399
here so we need to get everything in

374
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,959
terms of t

375
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,560
well we know x and y are both functions

376
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,519
of t so we can actually rewrite it like

377
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,200
this

378
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,200
we can rewrite it as

379
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,160
we can rewrite it as from t

380
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,560
is equal to a to t is equal to b

381
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,680
and f of x y we can write it f is a

382
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,920
function of x which is a function of t

383
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,399
and y is a func and f is also a function

384
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,240
of y which is also a function of t

385
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,240
so you give me a t i'll be able to give

386
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,880
you an x or a y and once you give me an

387
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,079
x or y i can figure out what f is so we

388
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,920
have that

389
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,079
and then we have this part right here

390
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,160
let's do it in orange

391
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,279
square root of d x squared plus d y

392
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,440
squared

393
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,880
but we still don't have things in terms

394
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,040
of t

395
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,560
we need a dt someplace here in order to

396
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,839
be able to evaluate this integral and

397
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,199
we'll see that in the next video when i

398
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,680
do a concrete problem but i really want

399
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,040
to give you a sense for the the end

400
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,240
product where the the formula we're

401
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
going to get this at the end product

402
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,959
this video where it comes from so one

403
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,440
thing we can do is if we if we allow

404
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,920
ourselves to algebraically manipulate

405
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,760
differentials what we could do is

406
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,920
let us multiply and divide by dt so one

407
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,160
way to think about it you could rewrite

408
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,839
so let me just take a do this orange

409
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
part right here let's do a little side

410
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,079
right here so if you take this orange

411
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,920
part and write it in pink and you have

412
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,399
dx squared

413
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,240
and then you have plus d y

414
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,560
squared and let's say we just multiply

415
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,040
it times dt

416
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,639
over dt right that's you know a small

417
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,000
change in t divided by a small change in

418
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,240
t that's one so of course you can

419
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,600
multiply it by that if we were to bring

420
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,839
this part

421
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,600
inside of the square root sign right so

422
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,440
let me let me rewrite this this is the

423
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,120
same thing as

424
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:55,040
1 over dt times the square root

425
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,040
of dx squared plus d y squared and then

426
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,480
times that dt

427
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,480
right i just wanted to write it this way

428
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,639
i'm just multiplying by one and here i'm

429
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,639
just taking this dt writing it there and

430
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,560
leaving this over here and now if i

431
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,639
wanted to bring this into the square

432
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,680
root sign this is the same thing this is

433
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,199
equal to

434
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,720
and i'll do it very slowly just to make

435
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,920
sure i'm not

436
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,839
allow you to believe that i'm not doing

437
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
anything shady with the algebra this is

438
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,800
the same thing as the square root of 1

439
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,959
over dt

440
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,880
squared let me make the radical a little

441
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,040
bit bigger times

442
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,279
dx squared

443
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,920
plus d y squared

444
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,360
and then all of that times dt

445
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,399
right i didn't do anything you could

446
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,000
just take the square root of this and

447
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,759
you get 1 over dt

448
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,959
and then if i just distribute this this

449
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,079
is equal to

450
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,320
this is equal to the square root the

451
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,079
square root and we have our dt out at

452
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,160
the end of

453
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,360
dx squared

454
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,120
or we could even write dx over dt

455
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
squared

456
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,279
plus

457
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
dy

458
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,360
over dt

459
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,839
squared right dx squared over dt squared

460
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,759
is just dx over dt squared same thing

461
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,759
with the y's and now all of a sudden

462
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,680
this starts to look pretty interesting

463
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,800
let's substitute this expression with

464
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,959
this one we said that these are

465
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,560
equivalent and i'll switch colors just

466
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,600
just for the sake of it so we have the

467
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,279
integral from t is equal to a let me get

468
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,680
our drawing back if i

469
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:22,480
from t is equal to a to t is equal to b

470
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,040
of f of x of t

471
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,440
times or f of x of t and f of or and y

472
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,959
of t they're both functions of t and now

473
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,720
instead of this expression we can write

474
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,759
the square root

475
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,399
the square root of well what's dx what's

476
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,240
what's the change in x with respect to

477
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,600
ti or whatever this parameter is what is

478
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,079
dx dt

479
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,560
dx dt is the same thing

480
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,560
dx dt let me write this down

481
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,199
dx dt

482
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,560
dx dt is the same thing actually i

483
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,600
should write it here it's the same thing

484
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,880
as

485
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,680
g prime

486
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,320
of t right x is a function of t the

487
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,560
function i wrote is g prime of t and

488
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,079
then this d y d t

489
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,439
d y d t is the same thing as h prime of

490
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,199
t we could say that you know this

491
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,720
function of t so i just want to make

492
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,160
that clear we know these two functions

493
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,760
so we can just take their derivatives

494
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,799
with respect to t but i'm just going to

495
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,039
leave it in that form so

496
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,000
the square root and we take

497
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,199
the derivative of x with respect to t

498
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,919
squared plus the derivative of y with

499
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,240
respect to t squared and then all of

500
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,799
that times dt and this might look like

501
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,320
some strange and convoluted formula but

502
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,559
this is actually something that we know

503
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,720
how to deal with we've now simplified

504
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,200
this strange

505
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,120
you know this arc length problem or this

506
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,160
line integral right that's essentially

507
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,880
what we're doing we're taking an

508
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,039
integral over a curve or over a line as

509
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,400
opposed to just an interval on the

510
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,080
x-axis

511
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,080
we've taken the strange

512
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,240
line integral that's in terms of the arc

513
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,160
length of the line and x's and y's and

514
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,280
we've put everything in terms of t and

515
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,039
i'm going to show you that in the next

516
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,640
video right everything is going to be

517
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,360
expressed in terms of t so this just

518
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,640
turns into a simple definite integral so

519
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,919
hopefully that didn't confuse you too

520
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,280
much i think you're going to see in the

521
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,360
next video that this right here is

522
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,640
actually a very straightforward thing to

523
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,320
implement and just to remind you where

524
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,559
it all came from i think there's i got

525
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,120
the parentheses right this right here

526
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,320
was just a change in our arc length that

527
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,760
whole thing right there was just a

528
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,880
change in arc length and this is just

529
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,400
the height

530
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,480
this is just the height

531
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,720
of our function at that point and we're

532
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,120
just summing it doing an infinite sum of

533
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,120
infinitely small lengths so this was the

534
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,799
change in our arc length times the

535
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,720
height this is going to have an

536
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,000
infinitely narrow width and you're going

537
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,919
to take an infinite number of these

538
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,760
rectangles to get the area of this and

539
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,160
of this entire fence or this entire

540
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,600
curtain and that's what this definite

541
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,880
integral will give us and we'll actually

542
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,880
apply it in the next video
