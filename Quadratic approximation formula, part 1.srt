1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,141
- [Voiceover] So, our setup is
that we have some kind of two

2
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:05,014
variable function f of x, y,

3
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:06,628
who has a scaler output,

4
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:08,316
and the goal is to approximate it

5
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:10,372
near a specific input point,

6
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:11,950
and this is something
I've already talked about

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,446
in context of a local linearization,

8
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:16,275
and I've written out the full local,

9
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:19,978
the full local linearization,
hard words to say,

10
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,116
local linearization in its most

11
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:24,012
abstract and general form,

12
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:25,496
and it looks like quite the beast,

13
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:27,018
but once you actually break it apart,

14
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:27,854
which I'll do in a moment, it's, it's

15
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:29,458
not actually that bad.

16
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,862
And the goal of this video is gonna be

17
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:33,219
to extend this idea and it'll literally be

18
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,634
just adding terms onto this formula

19
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:37,739
to get a quadratic approximation.

20
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:38,701
And what that means is,

21
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:40,533
we're starting to allow
ourselves to use terms

22
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:44,563
like x squared, x times y, and y squared.

23
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:46,123
And quadratic basically just means

24
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:48,979
any time you have two
variables multiplied together.

25
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,260
So here you have two
Xs multiplied together,

26
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,538
here it's an x multiplied with a y,

27
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:56,121
and here y squared, that kind of thing.

28
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,401
So let's take a look at
this local linearization.

29
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:59,347
It seems like a lot,

30
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:00,674
but once you actually
kind of go through term

31
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:02,614
by term, um, you realize

32
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:04,337
it's a relatively simple function,

33
00:01:04,337 --> 00:01:06,024
and if you were to plug in numbers

34
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,204
for the constant terms,

35
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:09,500
it would come out as
something relatively simple.

36
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,627
Cause this right here

37
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:12,106
where you're evaluating the function

38
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,537
at this specific input point,

39
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:15,251
that's just gonna be
some kind of constant.

40
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:17,656
That's just gonna output
some kind of number.

41
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:19,821
And similarly, when you do that to the,

42
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:22,283
the partial derivative, this little f of x

43
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,120
means partial derivative at that point,

44
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,783
you're just getting another number.

45
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:28,077
And over here, this is
also just another number,

46
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:29,802
but we've written it in
the abstract form so that

47
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:32,494
ah, you can see what you
would need to plug-in

48
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:35,129
for any function and for
any possible input point.

49
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,935
And the reason for having it like this,

50
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:38,891
the reason that it comes out to this form

51
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,893
is because of a few important properties

52
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,586
that this linearization has.

53
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:44,847
Let me move this stuff out of the way.

54
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:46,452
We'll get back to it in a moment, um, but

55
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:47,823
I just wanna emphasize

56
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:49,174
a few properties that this has

57
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:50,710
because it's gonna be
properties that we want

58
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,154
our quadratic approximation
to have as well.

59
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,396
First of all, when you
actually evaluate this function

60
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:59,979
at the desired point, at x knot, y knot,

61
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,868
what do you get?

62
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:05,124
Well, this constant term isn't influenced

63
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:08,261
by the variable, so you'll just get that f

64
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,314
evaluated at those points

65
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:11,564
x knot, y knot.

66
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:14,260
And now the rest of the terms.

67
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,093
When we plug-in x here,

68
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,837
this is the only place where
you actually see the variable.

69
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,380
Maybe that's worth pointing out, right?

70
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,646
We've got two variables here

71
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:20,816
and there's a lot going on,

72
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:23,082
but the only places where you
actually see those variables

73
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:25,442
show up where you have
to plug-in anything, um,

74
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,222
is over here and over here.

75
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:30,098
When you plug-in x knot
for our, our initial input,

76
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:33,527
this entire term goes to zero, right?

77
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:36,300
And then similarly when you
plug in y knot over here,

78
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,935
this entire term is gonna go to zero,

79
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:41,260
which multiplies out
to zero for everything.

80
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,271
So what you end up with,

81
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:43,656
you don't have to add anything else.

82
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:45,357
This is just a fact,

83
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:46,294
and this is an important fact

84
00:02:46,294 --> 00:02:47,332
cause it tells you your,

85
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:49,339
your approximation for the function

86
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:51,557
at the point about which
you are approximating,

87
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:53,669
actually equals the value of
the function at that point.

88
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:54,709
So that's very good.

89
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,451
But we have a couple
other important facts also

90
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:58,556
because this isn't just
a constant approximation,

91
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:00,426
this is doing a little bit more for us.

92
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:02,457
If you were to take the partial derivative

93
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:06,305
of this linearization
with respect to x, um,

94
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:07,948
what do you get?

95
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:08,781
What do you get when you actually

96
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:10,957
take this partial derivative?

97
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,030
Well, if you look up at
the original function

98
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,369
this constant term is nothing,

99
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:16,524
so that just corresponds to a zero.

100
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:18,772
Over here, this entire thing

101
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:22,440
looks like a constant
multiplied by x minus something,

102
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,736
and if you differentiate this

103
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,190
with respect to x,

104
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,368
what you're gonna get
is that constant term,

105
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:29,215
which is the partial derivative of f

106
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:32,298
evaluated at our, our specific point.

107
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,699
And then the other term has no Xs in it,

108
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,327
it's just a y, which as far
as x concerned is a constant.

109
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,430
So this whole thing would be zero.

110
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,791
Which means the partial derivative

111
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,959
with respect to x is equal to the value

112
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,070
of the partial derivative
of our original function

113
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,947
with respect to x at that point.

114
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:51,535
Now notice, this is not saying

115
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:54,375
that our linearization has
the same partial derivative

116
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,734
as f everywhere, it's just saying that

117
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:59,304
its partial derivative
happens to be a constant

118
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:00,731
and the constant that it is,

119
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:02,860
is the value of the
partial derivative of f

120
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,905
at that specific input point.

121
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:06,509
And you can do pretty much the same thing,

122
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:08,505
and you'll, you'll see that
the partial derivative of the

123
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:11,852
linearization with respect
to y is a constant,

124
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,683
and the constant that it happens to be

125
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:15,959
is the value of the
partial derivative of f

126
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,534
evaluated at that desired point.

127
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:19,718
So these are three facts.

128
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,190
You know the, the value of the

129
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,579
linearization at the point,

130
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:25,175
and the value of its two
different partial derivatives.

131
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,918
And these kind of define
the linearization itself.

132
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,264
Now what we're gonna do for
the quadratic approximation

133
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:31,986
is take this entire formula,

134
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:34,132
and I'm just literally gonna copy it here,

135
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:35,415
and then we're gonna add to it

136
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:37,909
so that the second partial
differential information

137
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:41,638
of our approximation matches
that of the original function.

138
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:42,696
Okay, that's kind of a mouthful,

139
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,951
but it'll become clear as I actually, um,

140
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,411
as I actually work it out.

141
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,762
Now, let me just kinda clean it up

142
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:50,363
at least a little bit here.

143
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:51,783
Um, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna

144
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:53,610
extend this, and I'm gonna change its name

145
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,084
because I don't want it to
be a linear function anymore.

146
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,623
What I want is for this to
be a quadratic function,

147
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:01,704
so instead, I'm gonna call it q of x, y.

148
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,447
And now we're gonna add some terms,

149
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:05,567
and what I could do, what I could do

150
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,228
is add, you know, a constant

151
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:09,641
times x squared, since that's
something we're allowed,

152
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:12,490
plus some kind of constant times x, y

153
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,119
and then another constant times y squared.

154
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,356
But the problem there, is that,

155
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:19,761
if I just add these as they are,

156
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,208
then it might mess things up when I

157
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,143
plug-in x knot and y knot, right?

158
00:05:23,143 --> 00:05:23,976
Well it was very important
that when you plug-in

159
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:26,770
those values, that you get the

160
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,179
original value of the function,

161
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:29,644
and that the partial derivatives

162
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:32,243
of the approximation also
match that of the function.

163
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:33,444
And that could mess things up,

164
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:34,538
because once you start plugging in

165
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:36,019
x knot and y knot over here,

166
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,303
that might actually mess with the value.

167
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,725
So we're basically gonna do the same thing

168
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:41,198
we did with the linearization,

169
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:42,629
where we put in,

170
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,892
every time we have an
x we kind of attach it,

171
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:46,339
we say x minus x knot,

172
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:48,016
just to make sure that
we don't mess things up

173
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:49,811
when we plug-in x knot.

174
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:53,360
So instead, instead of
what I had written there,

175
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,551
what we're gonna add as
our quadratic approximation

176
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:58,683
is some kind of constant,

177
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:00,196
and we'll fill in that
constant in a moment,

178
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:03,113
times x minus x knot squared,

179
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:06,718
and then we're gonna add

180
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:08,666
another constant multiplied by

181
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,083
x minus x knot

182
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:13,341
times y minus y knot

183
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:18,482
and then that times yet another constant,

184
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:21,358
which I'll call c multiplied by

185
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:23,275
y minus y knot squared.

186
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:27,877
All right, this is quite a lot going on.

187
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:29,186
This is a heck of a function

188
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:30,727
and these are three
different constants that

189
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:32,353
we're gonna try to fill in, um,

190
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:33,651
to figure out what they should be

191
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:37,058
to most closely approximate
the original function f.

192
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:38,980
Now the important part of making this

193
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,257
x minus x knot and y minus y knot

194
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:42,442
is that when we plug-in here,

195
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:43,999
when we plug-in, you know,

196
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,755
x knot for our variable x

197
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:49,666
and when we plug-in y
not for our variable y,

198
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,477
all of this stuff is just gonna go to zero

199
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,692
and it's gonna cancel out.

200
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:55,067
And moreover, when we take
the partial derivatives,

201
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,051
all of it's gonna go to zero as well.

202
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,101
And, and we'll see that in a moment,

203
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,583
maybe I'll just actually
show that right now.

204
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,711
Or rather, I think I'll
call the video done here

205
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:04,544
and then start talking about

206
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:07,505
how we fill in these
constants in the next video.

207
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:08,869
So I will see you then.
