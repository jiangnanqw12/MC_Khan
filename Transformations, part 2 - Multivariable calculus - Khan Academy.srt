1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,767
- [Voiceover] So in the
last video, I introduced

2
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:04,262
transformations and how you
can think about functions

3
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:07,107
as moving points in one
space to points in another,

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,823
and here I want to show an
example of what that looks like

5
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:12,668
when the input space is two-dimensional.

6
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:14,526
So this over here is the input space.

7
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:16,325
It's just a copy of the XY plane,

8
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,925
and the output space is also
two-dimensional, so the output

9
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:22,026
space, in this case, also
a two-dimensional plane.

10
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:25,079
And what I'm gonna do,
I'm just gonna first play

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,378
an example of one of these transformations

12
00:00:27,378 --> 00:00:29,920
and then go through the details
of the underyling function

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,067
and how you can understand the
transformation as a result.

14
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,446
So here's what it looks like.

15
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,977
Here's what we're gonna be going towards.

16
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:40,381
Very complicated, a lot of points moving.

17
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,204
Lots of different things happening here,

18
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:44,468
and what's common with this sort of thing,

19
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:46,360
when you're thinking about moving from

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,043
two dimensions to two dimensions,

21
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:50,145
given that it's really the
same space, the XY plane,

22
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:53,268
you often just think about
the input and output space

23
00:00:53,268 --> 00:00:55,439
all at once, and instead just watch

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,504
a copy of that plane move onto itself.

25
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:00,698
And by the way, when I
say watch, I don't mean

26
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:02,637
that you'll always have
an animation like this

27
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:04,320
just sort of sitting in front of you.

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,747
When I think about transformations,
it's usually a very

29
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:09,185
vague thought in the back
of my mind somewhere,

30
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:10,961
but it helps to understand what's

31
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:12,540
really going on with the function.

32
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,957
I'll talk about that more at the end,

33
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:16,465
but first let's just go
into what this function is.

34
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:19,739
So, the one that I told the
computer to animate here

35
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,324
is f of x,y is the input, is equal to

36
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:27,726
x squared plus y squared,

37
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:30,165
as the x component of the output,

38
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:32,603
and x squared minus y squared

39
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:35,098
is the y component of the output.

40
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:37,746
So just to help start understanding this,

41
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:40,706
let's take a relatively
simple point like the origin.

42
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,923
So here, the origin, which is zero, zero,

43
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:45,060
and let's think about
what happens to that.

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,999
f of zero, zero.

45
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,164
Well, x and y are both
zero, so that top is zero.

46
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:55,126
And same with the bottom,
that bottom also equals zero.

47
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:58,551
Which means, it's taking
the 0.00 to itself,

48
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,407
and if you watch the
transformation, what this means

49
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:05,354
is that the 0.0 stays fixed,
it's like you can hold

50
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:07,885
your thumb down on it, and
nothing really happens to it.

51
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:10,985
And in fact, we call this a
fixed point of the function

52
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:13,516
as a whole, and that kind of terminology

53
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:15,316
doesn't really make sense unless

54
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:17,673
you're thinking of the
function as a transformation.

55
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:19,936
So let's look at another example here.

56
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:22,873
Let's take a point like one, one.

57
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:25,614
f of one, one.

58
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:28,516
So in the input space, let's just kind of

59
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,790
start this thing over so we're
only looking at the input.

60
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,169
In the input space, one,
one, is sitting right here,

61
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:37,409
and we're wondering
where that's gonna move.

62
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,952
So when we plug it in,
x squared plus y squared

63
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:44,515
is gonna be one squared plus one squared,

64
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,848
and on the bottom, x
squared minus y squared,

65
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:49,693
one squared minus y squared.

66
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:51,794
Woop, (laughs) minus one squared.

67
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:54,411
I'm plugging things in here.

68
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:56,705
So that's two, zero.

69
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:00,420
Two, zero.

70
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,436
Which means we expect this point to move

71
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,457
over to two, zero in some way.

72
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,836
So if we watch the
transformation, we expect

73
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:11,903
to watch that point move over to here,

74
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:13,435
and again, it can be hard to follow

75
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:15,014
because there's a lot of moving parts,

76
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:17,058
but if you're careful as you watch it,

77
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:19,937
the point will actually land right there.

78
00:03:19,937 --> 00:03:22,735
And you can, in principle,
do this for any given point

79
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,883
and understand how it
moves from one to another,

80
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:27,216
but you might ask, hey Grant,

81
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:28,900
what is the point of all of this?

82
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,780
We have other ways of
visualizing functions that are

83
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,254
more precise, and kinda less
confusing, to be honest.

84
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,634
Factor fields are a great
way for functions like this,

85
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,700
graphs were a great way for functions

86
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,558
with one input and one output.

87
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:42,054
Why think in terms of transformations?

88
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,143
And the main reason is conceptual.

89
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:46,001
It's not like you'll have an
animation sitting in front

90
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,021
of you, and it's not
like you're gonna by hand

91
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:50,819
evaluate a bunch of points
and think of how they move.

92
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,733
But there's a lot of different
concepts in math, and with

93
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,102
functions, where when you
understand it in terms of

94
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,620
a transformation, it gives you
a more nuanced understanding.

95
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,336
Things like derivatives, or the
variations of the derivative

96
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:04,600
that you're gonna learn with
multi-variable calculus,

97
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,679
there's different ways of understanding it

98
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,780
in terms of stretching or squishing space

99
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,695
and things like this, that doesn't really

100
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:13,098
have a good analog in terms
of graphs or vector fields.

101
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:15,374
So it adds a new color
to your understanding.

102
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:17,801
Also, transformations are a super

103
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,821
important part of linear algebra.

104
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:21,493
There will come a point
when you start learning

105
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,455
the connection between linear algebra

106
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:25,359
and multi-variable calculus.

107
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:28,737
And if you have a strong
conception of transformations,

108
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:30,792
both in the context of linear algebra

109
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,998
and in the context of
multi-variable calculus,

110
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:35,355
you'll be in a much better
position to understand

111
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:37,827
the connection between those two fields.
