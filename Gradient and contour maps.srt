1
00:00:00,161 --> 00:00:01,229
- [Voiceover] So here I want to talk about

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:04,119
the gradient and the
context of a contour map.

3
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:06,409
So let's say we have a
multivariable function.

4
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:09,169
A two-variable function f of x,y.

5
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:12,111
And this one is just
gonna equal x times y.

6
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:15,551
So we can visualize
this with a contour map

7
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:17,036
just on the xy plane.

8
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:17,895
So what I'm gonna do

9
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,149
is I'm gonna go over here.

10
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:21,798
I'm gonna draw a y axis

11
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:24,455
and my x axis.

12
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:27,084
All right, so

13
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:28,981
this right here represents x values.

14
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:30,376
And this represents y values.

15
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:32,064
And this is entirely the input space.

16
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,760
And I have a video on contour maps

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,451
if you are unfamiliar with them

18
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:36,784
or are feeling uncomfortable.

19
00:00:36,784 --> 00:00:39,264
And the contour map for x times y

20
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:40,643
looks something like this.

21
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:43,695
And each one of these lines
represents a constant value.

22
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:46,434
So you might be thinking that you have,

23
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:47,735
you know, let's say you want a

24
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:52,157
the constant value for f of
x times y is equal to two.

25
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:53,689
Would be one of these lines.

26
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:55,907
That would be what one of
these lines represents.

27
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:57,296
And a way you could think about that

28
00:00:57,296 --> 00:00:58,518
for this specific function

29
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:01,548
is you saying hey, when
is x times y equal to two?

30
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:03,071
And that's kind of like the graph

31
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:05,236
y equals two over x.

32
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:09,599
And that's where you would
see something like this.

33
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,546
So all of these lines,

34
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:13,122
they're representing constant
values for the function.

35
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:15,440
And now I want to take a
look at the gradient field.

36
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,850
And the gradient, if you'll remember,

37
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,576
is just a vector full of the
partial derivatives of f.

38
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,589
And let's just actually write it out.

39
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:27,046
The gradient of f, with
our little del symbol,

40
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,553
is a function of x and y.

41
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:31,938
And it's a vector-valued function

42
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:33,929
whose first coordinate is

43
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:36,254
the partial derivative
of f with respect to x.

44
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:37,969
And the second component

45
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:42,125
is the partial derivative
with respect to y.

46
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:46,665
So when we actually do
this for our function,

47
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:49,017
we take the partial
derivative with respect to x.

48
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:49,846
It takes a look.

49
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:50,870
X looks like a variable.

50
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,065
Y looks like a constant.

51
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:53,546
The derivative of this whole thing

52
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:57,992
is just equal to that constant, y.

53
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,468
And then kind of the reverse for when you

54
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:01,409
take the partial derivative
with respect to y.

55
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,768
Y looks like a variable.

56
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:03,989
X looks like a constant.

57
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:07,039
And the derivative is
just that constant, x.

58
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,131
And this can be visualized
as a vector field

59
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,316
in the xy plane as well.

60
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:14,394
You know, at every given point, xy,

61
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:15,377
so you kind of go like

62
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:19,597
x equals two, y equals one, let's say.

63
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,710
So that would be x
equals two, y equals one.

64
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,344
You would plug in the vector

65
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,721
and see what should be output.

66
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:28,422
And at this point, the point is two, one.

67
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:30,423
The desired output kind of swaps those.

68
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:33,942
So we're looking somehow to
draw the vector one, two.

69
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:36,617
So you would expect to
see the vector that has

70
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:39,928
an x component of one
and a y component of two.

71
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:41,151
Something like that.

72
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:42,769
But it's probably gonna be scaled down

73
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:44,724
because of the way we
usually draw vector fields.

74
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:47,978
And the entire field looks like this.

75
00:02:47,978 --> 00:02:51,139
So I'll go ahead and
erase what I had going on.

76
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,217
Since this is a little bit clearer.

77
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:55,181
And remember, we scaled
down all the vectors.

78
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:56,309
The color represents length.

79
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,577
So red here is super-long.

80
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,802
Blue is gonna be kind of short.

81
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:01,619
And one thing worth noticing.

82
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:04,690
If you take a look at all
of the given points around,

83
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,350
if the vector is crossing a contour line,

84
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,358
it's perpendicular to that contour line.

85
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:10,129
Wherever you go.

86
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:10,942
You know, you go down here,

87
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:12,737
this vector's perpendicular
to the contour line.

88
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:15,115
Over here, perpendicular
to the contour line.

89
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:16,782
And this happens everywhere.

90
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:18,662
And it's for a very good reason.

91
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:20,300
And it's also super-useful.

92
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,094
So let's just think about
what that reason should be.

93
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:25,163
Let's zoom in on a point.

94
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,576
So I'm gonna clear up our function here.

95
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:29,350
Clear up all of the information about it.

96
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,434
And just zoom in on one of those points.

97
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:38,166
So let's say like right here.

98
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,979
We'll take that guy

99
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,896
and kind of imagine

100
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:44,845
zooming in and saying what's
going on in that region?

101
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:47,069
So you've got some kind of contour line.

102
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,899
And it's swooping down like this.

103
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:50,596
And that represents some kind of value.

104
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:53,071
Let's say that represents
the value f equals two.

105
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:56,272
And, you know, it might not
be a perfect straight line.

106
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:57,327
But the more you zoom in,

107
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:58,687
the more it looks like a straight line.

108
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:01,049
And when you want to
interpret the gradient vector.

109
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:03,532
If you remember, in the
video about how to interpret

110
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:05,303
the gradient in the context of a graph,

111
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:08,016
I said it points in the
direction of steepest descent.

112
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:10,541
So if you imagine all the possible vectors

113
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,777
kind of pointing away from this point,

114
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:15,352
the question is, which
direction should you move

115
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:18,293
to increase the value of f the fastest?

116
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:19,952
And there's two ways
of thinking about that.

117
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:22,378
One is to look at all of
these different directions

118
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:24,532
and say which one increases x the most?

119
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,063
But another way of doing it

120
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:27,683
would be to get rid of them all

121
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,637
and just take a look
at another contour line

122
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,234
that represents a slight increase.

123
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,101
All right, so let's say

124
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:34,548
you're taking a look at a contour line,

125
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:35,879
another contour line.

126
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,786
Something like this.

127
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:39,549
And maybe that represents
something that's right next to it.

128
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:40,783
Like 2.1.

129
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:43,876
That represents, you know,
another value that's very close.

130
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:45,379
And if I were a better artist,

131
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:47,369
and this was more representative,

132
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:48,544
it would look like a line

133
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:50,091
that's parallel to the original one.

134
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:52,084
Because if you change the output

135
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:52,993
by just a little bit,

136
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,935
the set of in points that look like it

137
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,853
is pretty much the same but
just shifted over a bit.

138
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:00,891
So another way we can think
about the gradient here

139
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:03,795
is to say of all of the vectors that move

140
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,915
from this output of two

141
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:07,925
up to the value of 2.1.

142
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:09,053
You know, you're looking at

143
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:10,839
all of the possible different
vectors that do that.

144
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,914
You know, which one does it the fastest?

145
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,728
And this time, instead of
thinking of the fastest

146
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,266
as constant-length vectors,

147
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,572
what increases it the most,

148
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:21,479
we'll be thinking, constant
increase in the output.

149
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,255
Which one does it with
the shortest distance?

150
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,906
And if you think of them as
being roughly parallel lines,

151
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:28,446
it shouldn't be hard to convince yourself

152
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:30,490
that the shortest distance isn't gonna be,

153
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,927
you know, any of those.

154
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:35,570
It's gonna be the one that connects them

155
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,029
pretty much perpendicular
to the original line.

156
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:39,390
Because if you think about these as lines,

157
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,363
And the more you zoom in,

158
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:42,772
the more they pretty much
look like parallel lines,

159
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:44,925
the path that connects one to the other

160
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:47,392
is gonna be perpendicular to both of them.

161
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:49,681
So because of this
interpretation of the gradient

162
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:51,236
as the direction of steepest descent,

163
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,567
it's a natural consequence

164
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,258
that every time it's on a contour line,

165
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:55,475
wherever you're looking

166
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,671
it's actually perpendicular to that line.

167
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:58,675
Because you can think about it

168
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:01,348
as getting to the next contour
line as fast as it can.

169
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:03,704
Increasing the function as fast as it can.

170
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:06,576
And this is actually a
very useful intepretation

171
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,184
of the gradient in different contexts.

172
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:10,438
So it's a good one to keep
in the back of your mind.

173
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:13,560
Gradient is always
perpendicular to contour lines.

174
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,566
Great.

175
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:15,936
See you next video.
