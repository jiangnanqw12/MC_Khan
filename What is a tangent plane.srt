00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,182
- [Voiceover] Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,182 --> 00:00:03,326
Here and in the next few videos
I'm gonna be talking about

3
00:00:03,326 --> 00:00:07,493
tangent planes of graphs,
and I'll specify this is

4
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:12,338
tangent planes of graphs
and not of some other thing

5
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:14,780
because in different context
of multivariable calculus you

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,728
might be taking a tangent plane
of say a parametric surface

7
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:20,975
or something like that but here
I'm just focused on graphs.

8
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:24,586
In the single variable
world a common problem that

9
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:26,673
people like to ask in calculus
is you have some sort of

10
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:30,736
curve and you wanna find at a
given point what the tangent

11
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:33,520
line to that curve is,
where the tangent line is.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,560
You’ll find the equation
for that tangent line

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,708
and this gives you various
information how to,

14
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,305
let's say you wanted to approximate
the function around that

15
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:42,940
point and it turns out to be
a nice simple approximation.

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,649
In the multivariable world
it's actually pretty similar

17
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:48,547
in terms of geometric intuition
it's almost identical.

18
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:50,771
You have some kind of graph of a function,

19
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:52,904
like the one that I have
here, and then instead of

20
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:55,420
having a tangent line,
because the line is a very

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,687
one-dimensional thing and here
it's a very two-dimensional

22
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:02,026
surface, instead you’ll have
some kind of tangent plane.

23
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:04,554
This is something where it's
just gonna be barely kissing

24
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:06,426
the graph in the same way
that the tangent line just

25
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:10,042
barely kisses the function
graph in the one-dimensional

26
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:12,592
circumstance, and it could be
at various different points

27
00:01:12,592 --> 00:01:14,256
rather than just being at that point.

28
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:17,329
You could move it around and
say that it will just barely be

29
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:21,166
kissing the graph of this
function but at different points.

30
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,444
Usually the way that a problem
like this will be framed

31
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:27,511
if you're trying to find such
a tangent plane is first,

32
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:30,820
you think about the specified
input that you want.

33
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,773
In the same way that over
in the single variable world

34
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:36,397
what you might do is say,
"What is the input value here?"

35
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:39,183
Maybe you'd name it like x
sub 0, and then you're gonna

36
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,190
find the graph of the
function that corresponds to

37
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,732
just kissing the graph
at that input point.

38
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:49,102
Over here in the multivariable
world, move things about,

39
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:51,942
you'll choose some input
point like this little red dot

40
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:54,035
and that could be at
various different spots,

41
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:55,091
it doesn’t have to be where I put it,

42
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:56,827
you could imagine putting
it somewhere else.

43
00:01:56,827 --> 00:02:00,232
Once you decide on what
input point you want,

44
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:02,252
you see where that is on the graph,

45
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,679
so we go and say, "That
input point corresponds to

46
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:06,570
such and such a height,"
so in this case it actually

47
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,409
looks like the graph is
about zero at that point

48
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:11,765
so the output of the
function would be zero.

49
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,188
What you want is the plane

50
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:15,414
that's tangent right at that point.

51
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:16,552
You’ll draw some kind of plane that's

52
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,885
tangent right at that point.

53
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:22,504
If we think about what this
inner point corresponds to

54
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:24,655
it's not x sub 0, a single variable input

55
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:26,842
like we have in the single variable world,

56
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:29,339
but instead that red dot
that you're seeing is gonna

57
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:33,506
correspond to some kind of
input here, x sub 0, y sub 0.

58
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:37,537
The ultimate goal over
here in our multivariable

59
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:40,199
circumstance is gonna be to
find some kind of new function,

60
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,198
so I'll write it down here,
some kind of new function

61
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:47,299
that I'll call L, for linear,
that's gonna take in x and y,

62
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:50,001
and we want the graph of that
function to be this plane,

63
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:53,112
and you might specify that this
is depended on the original

64
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:55,500
function that you have and
maybe also specify that it's

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,454
depended on this input point
in some way, but the basic idea

66
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:00,901
is we're gonna be looking
for a function whose graph

67
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:03,554
is this plane tangent at a given point.

68
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:05,552
In the next couple of videos
I'm gonna talk through

69
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,649
how you actually compute that.

70
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:08,789
It might seem a little intimidating
at first because how do

71
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,880
you control a plane in
three dimensions like this?

72
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,790
It's actually very similar
to the single variable

73
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,548
circumstance, and you just
take it one step at a time.

74
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:19,381
See you in next video.
