1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,540
- [Grant] All right, so last video

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,960
I showed you guys this really crazy fact.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,440
Now, we have our usual setup here

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,850
for this constrained
optimization situation.

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,510
We have a function we wanna maximize,

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,370
which I'm thinking of as
revenues for some company,

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,210
a constraint, which I'm thinking of

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,204
as some kind of budget for that company,

9
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:18,500
and as you know if you've
gotten to this video,

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,700
one way to solve this
constrained optimization problem

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,730
is to define this function
here, the Lagrangian,

12
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,180
which involves taking this function

13
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,230
that you're trying to maximize,

14
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,380
in this case the revenue,

15
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,000
and subtracting a new variable, lambda,

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,850
what's called the Lagrange multiplier,

17
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,000
times this quantity, which
is the budget function,

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,940
however much you spend

19
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,840
as a function of your input parameters,

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,150
minus the budget itself,

21
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,040
which you might think of
as $10,000 in our example.

22
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,440
So that's all the usual setup,

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,880
and the crazy fact,
which is just declared,

24
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,130
is that when you set this
gradient equal to zero,

25
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,830
and you find some solution,

26
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,840
and there will be three
variables in this solution:

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,560
h*, s*, and lambda*,

28
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,500
that this lambda* is not meaningless.

29
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,850
It's not just a proportionality constant

30
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,760
between these gradient vectors,

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,570
but it will actually tell you

32
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,510
how much the maximum
possible revenue changes

33
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,640
as a function of your budget,

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,200
and the way to start writing
all of that in formulas

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,700
would be to make explicit the fact that,

36
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,730
if you consider this value, the
$10,000 that is your budget,

37
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,970
which I'm calling b, a
variable and not a constant,

38
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,120
then you have to
acknowledge that h* and s*

39
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,120
are dependent on b, right?

40
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,720
It's a very implicit relationship,

41
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,890
something that's kind of
hard to think about at first,

42
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,270
because as you change b, it
changes what the Lagrangian is,

43
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,730
which is gonna change where
its gradient equals zero,

44
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,700
which changes what h*,
s*, and lambda* are,

45
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,770
but in principle,

46
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,723
they are some function
of that budget, of b,

47
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,060
and the maximum possible revenue

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,750
is whatever you get when you
just plug in that solution

49
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,220
to your function r,

50
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,830
and the claim I made, that I
just pulled out of the hat,

51
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,250
is that lambda*,

52
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,680
the lambda value that comes
packaged in with these two

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,890
when you set the gradient of
the Lagrangian equal to zero,

54
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,350
equals the derivative
of this maximum value,

55
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,500
thought of as a function of b.

56
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,070
Maybe I should emphasize that.

57
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,330
We're thinking of this maximum value

58
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,680
as a function of b, with respect to b.

59
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,820
So that's kind of a mouthful.

60
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,380
It takes a lot just to even
phrase what's going on,

61
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,250
but in the context of an economic example,

62
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,360
it has a very clear, precise meaning,

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
which is, if you increase
your budget by a dollar,

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,550
if you increase it from
$10,000 to $10,001,

65
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,383
you're wondering,

66
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,020
for that tiny change in
budget, that tiny db,

67
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,150
what is the ratio of the
resulting change in revenue?

68
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,960
So in a sense, this lambda* tells you,

69
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,010
for every dollar that
you increase the budget,

70
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,910
how much can your revenue increase

71
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,740
if you're always maximizing it?

72
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,070
So why on earth is this true, right?

73
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,320
This just seems like it
comes out of nowhere.

74
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,390
Well, there are a couple
clever observations

75
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,920
that go into proving this.

76
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,890
The first is to notice what happens

77
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,770
if we evaluate this
Lagrangian function itself

78
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,130
at this critical point, when you input

79
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,857
h*, s*, and lambda*,

80
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,530
and remember, the way that
these guys are defined

81
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,040
is that you look at all of the values

82
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,490
where the gradient of the
Lagrangian equals the zero vector,

83
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,130
and then, if you get
multiple options, you know,

84
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,930
sometimes when you set
the gradient equal to zero

85
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,540
you get multiple solutions,

86
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,947
and whichever one maximizes
R, that is h*, s*, lambda*.

87
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,430
So now I'm just asking, if you plug that,

88
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,360
not into the gradient of the Lagrangian,

89
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,440
but to the Lagrangian
itself, what do you get?

90
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,790
Well, you're going to get

91
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,280
we just look at its definition up here,

92
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,857
R evaluated at h* and s*,

93
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,903
right?

94
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,253
And we subtract off lambda*

95
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,160
times

96
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,637
B of h*, s*,

97
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,490
minus the constant that
is your budget, you know,

98
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,010
something you might think of as $10,000,

99
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,760
whatever you set little b equal to.

100
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,210
Okay, Grant, you might say,
why does this tell us anything?

101
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,430
You're just plugging in stars

102
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,150
instead of the usual variables,

103
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,030
but the key is that if
you plug in h* and s*,

104
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,400
this value has to equal zero

105
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,020
because h* and s* have to
satisfy the constraint.

106
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,360
Remember, one of the cool parts

107
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,810
about this Lagrangian
function as a whole is that

108
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,890
when you take its partial
derivative with respect to lambda,

109
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,260
all that's left is this
constraint function

110
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,980
minus the constraint portion.

111
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,730
When you set the gradient
of the Lagrangian

112
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,280
equal to the zero vector,

113
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,540
one component of that

114
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,620
is to set the partial derivative
with respect to lambda

115
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,613
equal to zero,

116
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:52,120
and if you remember from
the Lagrangian video,

117
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,590
all that really boils down to

118
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,100
is the fact that the
constraint holds, right?

119
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,520
Which would be your
budget achieves $10,000.

120
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,230
When you plug in the appropriate
h* and s* to this value,

121
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,050
you are hitting this
constrained amount of money

122
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,033
that you can spend.

123
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,650
So by virtue of how h* and s* are defined,

124
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,090
the fact that they are solutions

125
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,150
to the constrained optimization problem

126
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,303
means this whole portion goes to zero.

127
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,340
So we can just kind of cancel
all that out, and what's left

128
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,030
what's left here is the maximum
possible revenue, right?

129
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,863
So evidently,

130
00:05:23,863 --> 00:05:26,760
when you evaluate the Lagrangian
at this critical point,

131
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,980
at h*, s*, and lambda*, it equals M*.

132
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,170
It equals the maximum possible value

133
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,320
for the function you're
trying to maximize.

134
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,550
So ultimately, what we want

135
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,630
is to understand how that
maximum value changes

136
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,060
when you consider it a
function of the budget.

137
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,630
So evidently, what we can look for

138
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,860
is to just ask how the Lagrangian changes

139
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,333
as you consider it a
function of the budget.

140
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,200
Now, this is an interesting
thing to observe,

141
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,420
because if we just look up

142
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,210
at the definition of the Lagrangian,

143
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,100
if you just look at this formula,

144
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,320
if I told you to take
the derivative of this

145
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,330
with respect to little b,

146
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,840
how much does this change
with respect to little b,

147
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,410
you would notice that this goes to zero.

148
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,870
It doesn't have a little b.

149
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,533
This would also go to zero,

150
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,690
and all you'd be left with

151
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,940
would be negative lambda times negative b,

152
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,970
and the derivative of
that with respect to b

153
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,513
would be lambda.

154
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,570
So you might say, oh yeah,
of course, of course,

155
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,270
the derivative of that
Lagrangian with respect to b,

156
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,200
once we work it all out,

157
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,813
the only term that was
left there was the lambda,

158
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,260
and that's compelling,

159
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,560
but ultimately it's not entirely right.

160
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,530
That overlooks the fact

161
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,810
that L is not actually
defined as a function of b.

162
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,600
When we defined the Lagrangian,

163
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,090
we were considering b to be a constant.

164
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,900
So if you really wanna consider this

165
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,403
to be a function that involves b,

166
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,460
the way we should write it,

167
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,700
and I'll go ahead and erase this guy,

168
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,870
the way we should write this Lagrangian

169
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,010
is to say, you are a function of h*,

170
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,913
which itself is dependent on b,

171
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,070
and s*, which is also
a function of b, right?

172
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,290
As soon as we start
considering b a variable

173
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,320
and not a constant,

174
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,540
we have to acknowledge
that this critical point,

175
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,360
h*, s*, and lambda*,
depends on the value of b.

176
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,267
So likewise, that lambda*,

177
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,453
lambda* is also gonna be a function of b,

178
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,440
and then we can consider,
as a fourth variable, right,

179
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,323
so we're adding on yet another
variable to this function,

180
00:07:35,443 --> 00:07:36,833
the value of b itself,

181
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,303
the value of b itself here.

182
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,860
So now, when we wanna know,

183
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,920
what is the value of the Lagrangian

184
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,730
at the critical point, h*, s*, lambda*,

185
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,380
as a function of b, all right?

186
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,850
So that can be kind of confusing.

187
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,060
What you basically have is this function

188
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,090
that only really depends
on one value, right?

189
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,570
It only depends on b,

190
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,603
but it kinda goes through
a four-variable function,

191
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,290
and so, just to make it explicit,

192
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,530
this would equal the value of R

193
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,227
as a function of h*, and s*,

194
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,683
and each one of those is a
function of little b, right?

195
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,230
So this term is saying,
what's your revenue?

196
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,133
Evaluate it on the maximizing
h and s for the given budget,

197
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,037
and then you subtract off lambda*.

198
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,730
Oh here, I should probably

199
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,990
I'm not gonna have room here, am I?

200
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,793
So what you subtract off,

201
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,083
minus lambda*

202
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,230
at B

203
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,947
of h*,

204
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:51,879
and s*,

205
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,610
but each of these guys is
also a function of little b,

206
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,503
little b,

207
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,853
minus little b, right?

208
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,390
So you have this large

209
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,470
kind of complicated
multivariable function.

210
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,210
It's defined in terms of h*'s and s*'s,

211
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,510
which are themselves very implicit, right?

212
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,930
We just say, by definition

213
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,330
these are whatever values make
the gradient of L equal zero.

214
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,820
So very hard to think about
what that means concretely,

215
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,700
but all of this is really just dependent

216
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,563
on the single value, little b,

217
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,050
and from here, if we wanna
evaluate the derivative of L,

218
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,340
we wanna evaluate the
derivative of this Lagrangian

219
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,193
with respect to little b,

220
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,880
which is really the only
thing it depends on.

221
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,950
It's just via all of
these other variables,

222
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,773
we use the multivariable chain rule,

223
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,530
and at this point,

224
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,690
if you don't know the
multivariable chain rule,

225
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,730
I have a video on that.

226
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,860
Definitely pause.

227
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,693
Go take a look.

228
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,260
Make sure that it all makes sense.

229
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,740
But right here, I'm just gonna be assuming

230
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,560
that you know what the
multivariable chain rule is.

231
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,050
So what it is, is we take the partial

232
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,660
we're gonna look at
the partial derivatives

233
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,020
with respect to all four of these inputs.

234
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,853
So we'll start with

235
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:13,257
the partial derivative
of L with respect to h*,

236
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,387
with respect to h*,

237
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,000
and we're gonna multiply that

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,763
by the derivative of h* with respect to b,

239
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,450
and this might seem like a
very hard thing to think about,

240
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,970
like, how do we know how
h* changes as b changes?

241
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,520
But don't worry about it.

242
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,090
You'll see something magic
happen in just a moment.

243
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,220
And then we add in partial derivative of L

244
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,377
with respect to that second variable, s*,

245
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,280
with respect to whatever
the second variable is,

246
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,143
multiplied by the derivative of s*

247
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,133
with respect to b.

248
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,090
You can see how you really need to know

249
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,620
what the multivariable
chain rule is, right?

250
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,520
This would all seem
kind of out of the blue.

251
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,460
So what we now add in

252
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,687
is the partial derivative of L
with respect to that lambda*,

253
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,150
with respect to lambda*,

254
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,533
multiplied by the derivative of lambda*

255
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,033
with respect to little b,

256
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,063
and then finally,

257
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,520
finally, we take the partial
derivative of this Lagrangian

258
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,253
with respect to that little b,

259
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,960
which we're now considering
a variable in there, right?

260
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,050
We're no longer considering
that b a constant.

261
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,420
Multiplied by, well,
something kinda silly:

262
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,493
the derivative of b
with respect to itself.

263
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,760
So now, if you're thinking

264
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,040
that this is gonna be
horrifying to compute,

265
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,650
I can understand where you're coming from.

266
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,940
You have to know the derivative of lambda*

267
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,230
with respect to b.

268
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,230
You have to somehow
intimately be familiar with

269
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,470
how this lambda* changes as
you change b, and like I said,

270
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,740
that's such an implicit
relationship, right?

271
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,090
We just said that lambda*
is, by definition,

272
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,980
whatever the solution to
this gradient equation is.

273
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,250
So somehow you're supposed to know

274
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,460
how that changes when you
slightly alter b over here?

275
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,070
Well, you don't really
have to worry about things,

276
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,510
because by definition, h*, s*, and lambda*

277
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,050
are whatever values make the
gradient of L equal to zero,

278
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,610
but if you think about
that, what does it mean

279
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,640
for the gradient of L to
equal the zero vector.

280
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,530
Well, what it means is that
when you take its derivative

281
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,600
with respect to that first
variable, h*, it equals zero.

282
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,570
When you take its derivative

283
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,450
with respect to the second variable,

284
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,100
that equals zero as well,

285
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,300
and with respect to this third variable,

286
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,513
that's gonna equal zero.

287
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,530
By definition, h*, s*, and lambda*,

288
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,310
are whatever values make it the case,

289
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,920
so that when you plug them in,

290
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,420
the partial derivative of the Lagrangian,

291
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,110
with respect to any one of
those variables, equal zero.

292
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,100
So we don't even have to worry
about most of this equation.

293
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,992
The only part that matters here

294
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:56,290
is the partial derivative
of L with respect to b,

295
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,200
that we're now considering a variable,

296
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,923
multiplied by, well, what's db/db?

297
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,150
What is the rate of change

298
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,470
of a variable with respect to itself?

299
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,303
It's one.

300
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,423
It is one.

301
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,830
So all of this stuff, this
entire multivariable chain rule,

302
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,363
boils down to a single
innocent-looking factor,

303
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,000
which is the partial derivative of L,

304
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,520
partial derivative of L
with respect to little b,

305
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,490
and now there's something
very subtle here, right?

306
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,450
Because this might seem obvious.

307
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,430
I'm saying the derivative
of L with respect to b

308
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,823
equals the derivative
of L with respect to b,

309
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,620
but maybe I should give a
different notation here, right?

310
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,040
Because here, when I'm taking
the derivative, really,

311
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,180
I'm considering L as a
single-variable function, right?

312
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,760
I'm considering, not what happens

313
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,700
as you can freely change
all four of these variables.

314
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,140
Three of them are locked into place by b.

315
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,010
So maybe I should really
give that a different name.

316
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,070
I should call that L*.

317
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,400
L* is a single-variable function,

318
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,840
whereas this L is a
multivariable function.

319
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,690
This is the function where you
can freely change the values

320
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,530
of h, and s, and lambda,
and b, as you put them in.

321
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,840
So if we kind of scroll up
to look at its definition,

322
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,200
which I've written all over, I guess.

323
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,130
Here, let me actually rewrite
its definition, right?

324
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,450
I think that'll be useful.

325
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,180
I'm gonna rewrite that L,

326
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,233
if I consider it as a
four-variable function of h, s,

327
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,333
lambda, and b,

328
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,990
that what that equals is R

329
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,180
evaluated at h and s,

330
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,523
minus lambda,

331
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,230
multiplied by this constraint function B

332
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,783
evaluated at h and s, minus little b,

333
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,123
and this is now

334
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:47,200
when I'm considering
little b to be a variable.

335
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,700
So this is the Lagrangian

336
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,120
when you consider all four of these

337
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,240
to be freely changing as you want,

338
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,810
whereas the thing up here

339
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,870
that I'm considering a
single-variable function,

340
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,930
has three of its inputs locked into place.

341
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,763
So effectively,

342
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:02,620
it's just a single-variable
function with respect to b.

343
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,090
So it's actually quite miraculous

344
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,440
that the single-variable
derivative of that L, here,

345
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,950
I should L*, with respect to b,

346
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,080
ends up being the same as
the partial derivative of L,

347
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,570
this L, where you're free
to change all the variables,

348
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,090
that these should be the same.

349
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,390
Usually, in any usual circumstance,

350
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,340
all of these other terms would
have come into play somehow,

351
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,220
but what's special here is that

352
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,570
by the definition of this L*,

353
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,100
the specific way

354
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,940
in which these h*, s*, and
lambda*'s are locked into place

355
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,920
happens to be one

356
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,530
in which all of these partial
derivatives go to zero.

357
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,010
So that's pretty subtle, and
I think it's quite clever,

358
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,000
and what it leaves us with is that

359
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,640
we just have to evaluate
this partial derivative,

360
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,473
which is quite simple,

361
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:49,060
'cause we look down here, and you say,

362
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,140
what's the partial derivative
of L with respect to b?

363
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,300
Well, this R has no b's in it,

364
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,310
so don't need to care about that.

365
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,880
This term over here, its partial
derivative is negative one

366
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,180
just 'cause there's a b here,

367
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,430
and that's multiplied
by the constant lambda,

368
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,643
so that all just equals lambda,

369
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,320
but if we're in the situation

370
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,480
where lambda is locked into
place as a function of little b,

371
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,123
then we'd write lambda* as a
function of little b, right?

372
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,960
So if that feels a little
notationally confusing,

373
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,110
I'm right there with you,

374
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,540
but the important part here,
the important thing to remember

375
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,183
is that we just started
considering b as a variable,

376
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,310
and we were looking at
the h*, s*, and lambda*,

377
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,850
as they depended on that variable.

378
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,610
We made the observation
that the Lagrangian,

379
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,720
evaluated at that critical point,

380
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,330
equals the revenue evaluated
at that critical point.

381
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,380
The rest of the stuff just cancels out.

382
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,700
So if you wanna know the derivative of M*,

383
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,190
the maximizing revenue,
with respect to the budget,

384
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,820
how much does your maximum revenue change

385
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,570
for tiny changes in your budget?

386
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,010
That's the same as
looking at the derivative

387
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,570
of the Lagrangian with
respect to the budget,

388
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,000
so long as you're considering it

389
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,020
only on values h*, s*, lambda*,

390
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,640
that are critical points
of the Lagrangian,

391
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,850
and all of that really nicely boils down

392
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,200
to just taking a simple partial derivative

393
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,950
that gives us the relation we want.
