00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,963
- [Voiceover] So in the last video,

2
00:00:01,963 --> 00:00:04,553
I talked about Vector fields,
and here I want to talk

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:07,058
about a special circumstance
where they come up.

4
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:10,094
So imagine that we're sitting
in the coordinate plane,

5
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:11,572
and that I draw for you a whole bunch

6
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:14,885
of little droplets, droplets
of water, and then these are

7
00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:16,653
going to start flowing in some way.

8
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:21,147
How would you describe
this flow mathematically?

9
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:24,615
So at every given point, the particles

10
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:25,928
are moving in some different way.

11
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:28,227
Over here, they're kind of
moving down and to the left.

12
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:29,947
Here, they're moving kind of quickly up.

13
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,016
Over here, they're
moving more slowly down.

14
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:34,687
So what you might want
to do is assign a vector

15
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:37,642
to every single point in space,

16
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:39,911
and a common attribute of
the way that fluids flow.

17
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:43,697
This isn't necessarily
obvious, but if you look

18
00:00:43,697 --> 00:00:46,975
at a given point in space,
let's say like right here,

19
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:49,290
every time that a particle
passes through it,

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,972
it's with roughly the same velocity,

21
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:53,072
so you might think over time that velocity

22
00:00:53,072 --> 00:00:54,399
would change, and sometimes it does.

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,241
A lot of times there's some fluid flow

24
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,530
where it depends on
time, but for many cases

25
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,737
you can just say, at this point in space,

26
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:04,253
whatever particle is going through it,

27
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:05,807
it'll have this velocity vector.

28
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:08,368
So over here, they might
be pretty high upwards,

29
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,561
whereas here, it's kind of
a smaller vector downwards,

30
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:16,561
even though, I'll play the
animation a little bit more here,

31
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:20,651
and if you imagine doing this
at all of the different points

32
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:23,444
in space, and assigning
a vector to describe

33
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:26,280
the motion of each fluid
particle at each different point,

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,108
what you end up getting is a vector field.

35
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:32,216
So this here is a little
bit of a cleaner drawing

36
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:35,497
than what I have, and as I
mentioned in the last video,

37
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:37,984
it's common for these vectors
not to be drawn to scale,

38
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:39,779
but to all have the
same length, just to get

39
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:41,764
a sense of direction, and here you can see

40
00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:45,692
each particle is flowing
roughly along that vector,

41
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:47,388
so whatever one it's closest to,

42
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:49,439
it's moving in that direction.

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,021
And this is not just a really
good way of understanding

44
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:54,297
fluid flow, but it goes
the other way around.

45
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:55,691
It's a really good way of understanding

46
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:58,531
vector fields themselves,
so sometimes you might

47
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:01,245
just be given some new vector field,

48
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:03,826
and to get a feel for what it's all about,

49
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:06,549
how to interpret it, what
special properties it might have,

50
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,935
it's actually helpful, even
if it's not meant to represent

51
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:11,275
a fluid, to imagine that
it does, and think of all

52
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:14,206
the particles, and think of
how they would move along in.

53
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:18,977
For example, this particular
one, as you play the animation,

54
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:22,754
as you let the particles
move along the vectors,

55
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:24,644
there's no change in the density.

56
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,661
At no point do a punch
of particles go inward,

57
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:28,345
or a bunch of particles go outward,

58
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:30,305
it stays kind of constant,
and that turns out

59
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:33,683
to have a certain mathematical
significance down the road.

60
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:35,573
You'll see this later on as we study

61
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,467
a certain concept called divergence.

62
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,872
And over here, you see this vector field,

63
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:43,267
and you might want to
understand what it's all about,

64
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:45,143
and it's kind of helpful
to think of a fluid

65
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:48,360
that pushes outward from everywhere,

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,624
and is kind of decreasing in
density around the center,

67
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:53,747
and that also has a certain
mathematical significance,

68
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:56,665
and it might also lead you to
ask certain other questions.

69
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:57,936
Like if you look at the fluid flow

70
00:02:57,936 --> 00:02:59,735
that we started with in this video,

71
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:02,083
you might ask a couple
questions about it like

72
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,548
it seems to rotating around some points,

73
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:06,808
in this case counter
clockwise, but it's rotating

74
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:08,383
clockwise around others still.

75
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,873
Does that have any kind of
mathematical significance?

76
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:15,096
Does the fact that there
seem to be the same

77
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:16,861
number of particles roughly in this area,

78
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:18,518
but they're slowly spilling out there.

79
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:20,188
What does that imply for the function

80
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:23,540
that represents this whole vector field,

81
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,705
and you'll see a lot of this later on,

82
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,929
especially when I talk
about divergence and curl,

83
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:29,938
but here I just wanted to
give a little warmup to that

84
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:32,931
as we're just visualizing
multivariable functions.
