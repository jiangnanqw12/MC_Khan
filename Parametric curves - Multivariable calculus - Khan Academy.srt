00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,711
- [Voiceover] More
function visualizations.

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,644
So let's say you have a function

3
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:06,831
that's got a single input t.

4
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:09,813
And then it outputs a vector.

5
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:11,869
And the vector's gonna depend on t.

6
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:16,136
So the x component will be
t times the cosine of t.

7
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:21,906
And then the y component will
be t times the sine of t.

8
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:25,530
This is what's called
a parametric function.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,119
And I should maybe say
one-parameter parametric function.

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,134
One parameter.

11
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:34,695
And "parameter" is just kind
of a fancy word for input.

12
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:36,374
Parameter.

13
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:40,562
So in this case, t is
our single parameter.

14
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:42,157
And what makes it a parametric function

15
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:44,834
is that we think about
it as drawing a curve

16
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:47,143
and its output is multidimensional.

17
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:49,590
So you might think, when you
visualize something like this,

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,297
ah, it's got, you know, a single input.

19
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:53,233
And it's got a two-dimensional output.

20
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:54,080
Let's graph it.

21
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,132
You know, put those three
numbers together and plot them.

22
00:00:57,132 --> 00:00:58,729
But what turns out to be even better

23
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,508
is to look just in the output space.

24
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:03,714
So in this case, the output
space is two-dimensional.

25
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:07,078
So I'll go ahead and draw
a coordinate plane here.

26
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:09,622
And let's just evaluate this function

27
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:10,868
at a couple different points

28
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:12,968
and see what it looks like, okay.

29
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:15,028
So I might, maybe the easiest place

30
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:16,539
to evaluate it would be zero.

31
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,186
So f of zero

32
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:24,612
is equal to,

33
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:27,665
and then, in both cases,
it'll be zero times something.

34
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:30,891
So zero times cosine of zero is just zero.

35
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,882
And then zero times sine
of zero is also just zero.

36
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:37,396
So that input corresponds to the output.

37
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:39,653
You could think of it as a
vector that's infinitely small

38
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:41,974
or just the point at the origin,

39
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:43,594
however you want to go about it.

40
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:45,056
So let's take a different point,

41
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,419
just to see what else could happen.

42
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:51,013
And I'm gonna choose pi halves.

43
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:55,064
Of course, the reason
I'm choosing pi halves,

44
00:01:55,064 --> 00:01:57,312
of all numbers, is that
it's something I know

45
00:01:57,312 --> 00:01:59,097
how to take the sine and the cosine of.

46
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,426
So t is pi halves, cosine of pi halves.

47
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:06,041
And you start thinking, okay,

48
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,273
what's the cosine of pi halves?

49
00:02:07,273 --> 00:02:08,663
What's the sine of pi halves?

50
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:11,458
And maybe you go off and
draw a little unit circle

51
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,203
while you're writing things out.

52
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:14,902
Whoops.

53
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:18,732
See the problem with
talking while writing.

54
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:20,838
Sine of pi halves.

55
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:26,303
And you know it's,

56
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:28,841
if you go off and scribble
that little unit circle.

57
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:30,574
And you say pi halves is gonna bring us

58
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:32,013
a quarter of the way around.

59
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:33,179
Over here.

60
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:36,205
And cosine of pi halves is measuring

61
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:37,542
the x component of that.

62
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,320
So that just cancels out to zero.

63
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,308
And then sine of pi halves

64
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:45,004
is the y component of that.

65
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:46,723
So that ends up equaling one.

66
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:51,832
Which means that the vector as a whole

67
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:57,744
is gonna be zero for the x component

68
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,796
and then pi halves for the y component.

69
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:02,407
And what that would look like,

70
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:04,973
you know, the y component of pi halves

71
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:07,183
is about 1.7 up there.

72
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:08,508
There's no x component.

73
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:10,011
So you might get a vector like this.

74
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:11,550
And if you imagine doing this

75
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,124
at all the different input points,

76
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:15,210
you might get a bunch of different vectors

77
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,060
off doing different things.

78
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,468
And if you were to draw it,

79
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:21,080
you don't want to just
draw the arrows themselves.

80
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,749
Because that'll clutter
things a whole bunch.

81
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:24,725
So we just want to trace the points

82
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:27,219
that correspond to the output,
the tips of each vector.

83
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,741
And what I'll do here, I'll
show a little animation.

84
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,956
Let me just clear the board a bit.

85
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,153
An animation where

86
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:36,680
I'll let t range between zero and 10.

87
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,323
So let's write that down.

88
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:44,973
So the value t is gonna start at zero.

89
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:47,411
And then it's gonna go to 10.

90
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:50,202
And we'll just see what values,

91
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:52,171
what vectors does that output.

92
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:55,483
And what curve does the tip
of that vector trace out?

93
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,813
So there it goes.

94
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:01,199
All of the values just kind
of ranging, zero to 10.

95
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,453
And you end up getting this spiral shape.

96
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:05,099
And you can maybe think about why

97
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,272
this cosine of t, sine of t
scaled by the value t itself

98
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:09,542
would give you this spiral.

99
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,576
But what it means is that when you,

100
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:14,948
you know, we saw that zero goes here.

101
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:19,591
Evidently, it's the case
that 10 outputs here.

102
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:21,578
And a disadvantage of
drawing things like this,

103
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:24,619
you're not quite sure of
what the interim values are.

104
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:25,731
You know, you could kind of guess.

105
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:27,230
Maybe one goes somewhere here.

106
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,801
Two goes somewhere here.

107
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,144
And you're kind of hoping
that they're evenly spaced

108
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:32,441
as you move along.

109
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,638
But you don't get that information.

110
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:36,388
You lose the input information.

111
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:37,704
You get the shape of the curve.

112
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:39,122
And if you just want, you know,

113
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:40,953
an analytical way of describing curves,

114
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:43,025
you find some parametric
function that does it.

115
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,979
And you don't really care about the rate.

116
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,577
But just to show where it might matter,

117
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,482
I'll animate the same thing again,

118
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:51,332
another function that
draws the same curve.

119
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,236
But it starts going really quickly.

120
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:55,577
And then it slows down as you go on.

121
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,945
So that function is not quite
the t cosine t, t sine of t

122
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:01,482
that I originally had written.

123
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:02,972
And in fact, it would mean that,

124
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,239
let's just erase these guys.

125
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:08,728
When it starts slowly,

126
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:11,298
you can interpret that
as saying, okay maybe...

127
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:12,795
Well, actually, it started
quickly, didn't it?

128
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:15,598
So one would be really far off here.

129
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,340
And then two, we kind
of zipped along here.

130
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,517
And three, you know,
still going really fast.

131
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:21,316
And then maybe by the
time you get to the end,

132
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:22,773
it's just going very slowly,

133
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:24,925
just kind of seven is here, eight is here,

134
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,801
and it's hardly making any
progress before it gets to 10.

135
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:29,660
So you can have two different functions

136
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,990
draw the same curve.

137
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,670
And the fancy word here is "parameterize."

138
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,363
So functions will parameterize a curve

139
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:38,898
if, when you draw just
in the output space,

140
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:40,411
you get that curve.

141
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:41,455
And in the next video,

142
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:43,307
I'll show how you can have functions

143
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:44,668
with a two-dimensional input

144
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,227
and a three-dimensional output

145
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:49,430
draw surfaces in three-dimensional space.
