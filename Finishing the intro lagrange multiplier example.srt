00:00:00,547 --> 00:00:01,589
- [Instructor] So in the last two videos

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,576
we were talking about this
constrained optimization problem

3
00:00:04,576 --> 00:00:07,170
where we want to maximize
a certain function

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,820
on a certain set, the
set of all points x, y

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,152
where x squared plus y squared equals one.

6
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:13,792
And we ended up working
out through some nice,

7
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:15,683
geometrical reasoning
that we need to solve

8
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,360
this system of equations.

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,533
So there's nothing left
to do but to just solve

10
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,021
this system of equations.

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,524
I will start with this
first one at the top,

12
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:23,927
see what we can simplify.

13
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:26,311
We notice there's an x term in each one

14
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,603
so we'll go ahead and cancel those out,

15
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:30,333
which is basically a way
of saying we're assuming

16
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,014
that x is not zero, and we
can kind of return to that

17
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:35,695
to see if x equals zero
could be as you wish.

18
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:36,921
And so maybe we'll kind
of write that down.

19
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:39,500
We're assuming x is not equal to zero

20
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,501
in order to cancel out.

21
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,213
And we kind of can revisit whether that

22
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:44,297
could give us another
possible solution later,

23
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:48,399
but that will be two times y
is equal to lambda times two,

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,231
and from here, the twos can cancel out,

25
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:53,732
no worries about two equaling zero,

26
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:56,002
and we know that y equals lambda.

27
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:59,565
So that's a nice, simplified
form for this equation.

28
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:01,446
And for this next
equation, though we can use

29
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:03,821
what we just found, that
y is equal to lambda

30
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:07,091
to replace the lambda
that we see, and instead,

31
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:10,198
if I replace this with
a y, what I'm gonna get

32
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:14,050
is that x squared is equal
to y times two times y.

33
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,825
So that's two times y squared.

34
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:19,106
And I'll leave it in
that form because I see

35
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:20,849
that in the next equation,
I see an x squared,

36
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,251
I see a y squared, so it might be nice

37
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:24,784
to be able to plug this guy right into it.

38
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,455
So in that next equation, x squared,

39
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,099
I'm gonna go ahead and
replace that with y squared,

40
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,016
so that's two y squared

41
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:35,558
plus y squared equals one.

42
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:41,015
And then from there, simplifies
to three times y squared

43
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,537
equals one, which in turn means y squared

44
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,400
is equal to one third,

45
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,233
and so y is equal to plus or minus

46
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:56,293
the square root of one third.

47
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:57,126
Great.

48
00:01:57,126 --> 00:01:59,585
So this gives us y, and
I'll go ahead and put a box

49
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:03,513
around that, where we
have found what y must be.

50
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:05,811
Now if y squared is equal to one third,

51
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:07,375
then we look up here and say, mhm,

52
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,428
two times y squared, that's
gonna be the same thing

53
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:14,345
as two times one third,
so two times one third,

54
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:18,770
so if x squared is equal to two thirds,

55
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,208
what that implies is that x

56
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,625
is equal to plus or minus the square root

57
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:26,731
of two thirds.

58
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,329
And then there we go, that's another,

59
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,603
one of the solutions.

60
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:34,371
And I could write down
what lambda is, right,

61
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:37,279
I mean, in this case it's
easy, 'cause y equals lambda,

62
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,605
but all we really want in
their final form are x and y,

63
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:40,991
since that's gonna give us the answer

64
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:42,958
to the original constraint problem.

65
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,728
So this, this gives us what we want,

66
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:47,598
and we just have that
pesky, little possibility

67
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:49,480
that x equals zero to address,

68
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,999
and for that we can take a look and say,

69
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,007
if x equaled zero, you
know let's go through

70
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,435
the possibility that
maybe that's one of the

71
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:57,308
constrained solutions.

72
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:59,572
Well, in this equation
that would make sense,

73
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,690
since two times zero would equal zero.

74
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,758
In this equation, that would
mean that we're setting zero

75
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:06,888
equal to lambda times two times y.

76
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:08,946
Well, since lambda
equals y, that would mean

77
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:10,985
that for this side to equal zero,

78
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:13,759
y would have to equal zero, so evidently,

79
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,463
you know, if it was the
case that x equals zero,

80
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,790
that would have to imply,

81
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,535
from the second equation
that y equals zero,

82
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,160
but if x and y both equal zero,

83
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,358
this constraint can't be satisfied.

84
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:26,102
So none of this is
possible, so we never even

85
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:27,828
had to worry about this to start with,

86
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:29,238
but it's something you do need to check,

87
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:31,249
just every time you're
dividing by a variable,

88
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:35,564
you're basically assuming
that it's not equal to zero.

89
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:39,040
So, this right here gives
us four possible solutions,

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,788
four possible values for x and y

91
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,385
that satisfy this constraint,
and which potentially

92
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,199
maximize this, and remember, when I say

93
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,138
potentially maximize, the whole idea

94
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:51,290
of this Lagrange Multiplier,
is that we were looking

95
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,897
for where there's a point of tangency

96
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:56,353
between the contour lines.

97
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,289
So just to make it
explicit, the four points

98
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:00,444
that we're dealing with, here
I'll right them all here.

99
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:04,444
So, x could be the square
root of two thirds,

100
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:07,444
square root of two thirds,

101
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:11,949
and y could be the positive
square root of one third,

102
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:13,493
and then we can basically just toggle,

103
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:17,535
you know maybe x is the negative
square root of two thirds

104
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:21,146
and y is still the positive
square root of one third,

105
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:25,046
or maybe x is the positive square root of

106
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:30,019
two thirds, and y is the negative
square root of one third,

107
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,302
kind of monotonous, but just getting

108
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:34,042
all of the different
possibilities on the table here.

109
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:36,811
X is negative square root of two thirds,

110
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:41,718
and then y is positive, no,
negative, that's the last one,

111
00:04:41,718 --> 00:04:43,805
square root of one third.

112
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:46,640
So these are the four points
where the contour lines

113
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,286
are tangent, and to
find which one of these

114
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:50,549
maximizes our function,

115
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,316
here let's go ahead and write
down our function again,

116
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:53,587
it gets easy to forget.

117
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:55,338
So the whole thing we're
doing is maximizing

118
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:58,347
f of x, y, equals x squared times y.

119
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:01,006
So let me just put that down again,

120
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:03,173
we're looking at f of x, y

121
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:07,579
is equal to x squared times y.

122
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:11,327
So we could just plug these values in

123
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,458
and see which one of them
is actually greatest.

124
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,845
And the first thing to observe is,

125
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,903
x squared is always gonna be positive,

126
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:19,048
so if I plug in a negative value for y,

127
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:22,190
right, if I plug in either
this guy here or this guy here,

128
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,858
where the value for y is negative,

129
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,924
the entire function would be negative.

130
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:27,617
So I'm just gonna say
that neither of these

131
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:30,453
can be the maximum because
it'll be some positive number,

132
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,900
some x squared times a negative.

133
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,459
Whereas I know that these
guys are gonna produce

134
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,352
a positive number, and specifically,

135
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:39,252
now if we plug in, if we
plug in f of let's say

136
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:42,585
this top one, square root of two thirds,

137
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:46,261
square root of one third, well,

138
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:49,616
x squared is gonna be two thirds,

139
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:53,172
and then y is square root of one third.

140
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,416
And in fact that's gonna be the same

141
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,396
as what we get plugging
in this other value.

142
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:58,850
So either one of these
maximizes the function.

143
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,977
It's got two different maximizing points

144
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:03,898
and each one of them has a maximum value

145
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:08,363
of two thirds times the
square root of one third.

146
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:09,876
And that's the final answer.

147
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:12,180
But I do want to emphasize,
that the takeaway here

148
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,449
is not the specific
algebra that you work out

149
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:16,882
going towards the end, but it's the whole,

150
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:19,261
the whole idea of this
Lagrange Multiplier technique

151
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:21,421
to find the gradient of one function,

152
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,954
find the gradient of the
constraining function,

153
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:25,762
and then set them
proportional to each other.

154
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,862
That's the key takeaway, and
then the rest of it is just,

155
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:30,875
you know making sure
that we check our work

156
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,713
and go through the minute details,

157
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:35,340
which is important, it has its place.

158
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,125
And coming up, I'll go
through a few more examples.
