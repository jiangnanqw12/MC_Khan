00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,289
- [Teacher] So, just as a
reminder of where we are,

2
00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:04,571
we've got this very
non-linear transformation

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,558
and we showed that if you zoom
in on a specific point while

4
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:09,046
that transformation is happening,

5
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:10,968
it looks a lot like something linear

6
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:12,772
and we reason that you can figure out

7
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:14,854
what linear transformation that looks like

8
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:17,922
by taking the partial derivatives
of your given function,

9
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:19,897
the one that I defined up here,

10
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:22,514
and then turning that into a matrix.

11
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:24,599
And what I want to do here
is basically just finish up

12
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,315
what I was talking about by computing all

13
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:27,802
of those partial derivatives.

14
00:00:27,802 --> 00:00:30,298
So, first of all, let me
just rewrite the function

15
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,553
back on the screen so we have it

16
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:33,598
in a convenient place to look at.

17
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:37,884
The first component is x plus sin of y.

18
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:40,217
Sin of y and then y plus sin

19
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:45,097
of x was the second component.

20
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:47,390
So, what I want to do
here is just compute all

21
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,819
of those partial derivatives to show

22
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,627
what kind of thing this looks like.

23
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:54,270
So, let's go ahead and
get rid of this word

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,401
and I'll go ahead and kind
of redraw the matrix here.

25
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:59,868
So, for that upper left component,

26
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,723
we're taking the partial derivative

27
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:04,231
with respect to x of the first component.

28
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,799
So, we look up at this first component

29
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,335
and the partial derivative
with respect to x is just one.

30
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,049
Since there's one times x plus
something that has nothing

31
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,005
to do with x and then below that,

32
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:15,064
we take the partial derivative

33
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:17,829
of the second component
with respect to x down here.

34
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:20,593
And that guy, the y, well
that looks like a constant

35
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:22,995
so nothing happens, and
the derivative of sin

36
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:25,328
of x becomes cosine of x.

37
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:30,563
And then up here, we're
taking the partial derivative

38
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:32,826
with respect to y of the first component;

39
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,739
that upper one here, and for that,

40
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,779
partial derivative of x,
with respect to y, is zero

41
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:39,626
and partial derivative of sin of y,

42
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:42,459
with respect to y, is cosine of y.

43
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:46,343
And then, finally, the partial derivative

44
00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:50,506
of the second component with
respect to y looks like one

45
00:01:50,506 --> 00:01:54,151
because it's just one
times y plus some constant.

46
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:57,461
And this is the general Jacobian
as a function of x and y,

47
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:58,986
but if we want to understand what happens

48
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,383
around this specific
point that started off

49
00:02:01,383 --> 00:02:04,110
at, well, I think I recorded
it here at negative two, one,

50
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,779
we plug that in to each
one of these values.

51
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:10,367
So, when we plug in negative two, one.

52
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,409
So go ahead and just
kind of again, rewrite it

53
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:15,979
to remember we're plugging
in negative two, one

54
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:20,133
as our specific point,
that matrix as a function,

55
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:22,257
kind of a matrix valued function,

56
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:25,307
becomes one, and then next we have cosine,

57
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:27,705
but we're plugging in negative two for x,

58
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:30,036
cosine of negative two,
and if you're curious,

59
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:32,580
that is approximately equal to,

60
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,249
I calculated this earlier.

61
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:38,158
Negative zero point four
two, if you just want

62
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,758
to think in terms of a number there.

63
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:42,993
Then for the upper right,
we have cosine again,

64
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:45,118
but now we're plugging in the value for y,

65
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:48,550
which is one and cosine of
one is approximately equal

66
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,467
to zero point five four;
and then bottom right,

67
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,212
that's just another constant: one.

68
00:02:56,212 --> 00:03:00,250
So, that is the matrix, just
as a matrix full of numbers,

69
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,361
and just as kind of a gut
check we can take a look

70
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:05,148
at the linear transformation
this was supposed to look like,

71
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:07,008
and notice how the first basis factor,

72
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:10,615
the thing it got turned into,
which is this factor here,

73
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:13,182
does look like it has coordinates one

74
00:03:13,182 --> 00:03:15,210
and negative zero point four two, right?

75
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,669
It's got this rightward component

76
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:18,792
that's about as long as
the vector itself started

77
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,188
and then this downward component,

78
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:21,920
which I think that's pretty believable

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,523
that that's negative zero point four two.

80
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:26,821
And then, likewise, this
second column is telling us

81
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:29,120
what happened to that second basis factor,

82
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,115
which is the one that looks like this.

83
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:35,529
And again, its y component
is about as long as

84
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,982
how it started, right, the length of one.

85
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:40,833
And then the rightward component
is around half of that,

86
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,663
and we actually see that in the diagram,

87
00:03:42,663 --> 00:03:43,847
but this is something you compute.

88
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:44,801
Again, it's pretty straightforward.

89
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,696
You just take all of the
possible partial derivatives,

90
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:50,172
and you organize them
into a grid like this.

91
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:52,405
So, with that, I'll see
you guys next video.
