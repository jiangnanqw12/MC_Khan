1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,120
so i've written here three different

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,120
functions the first one is a

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,200
multivariable function it has a two

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,360
variable input x y

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,519
and a single variable output that's x

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,360
squared times y that's just a number and

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,199
then the other two functions are each

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,920
just regular old single variable

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,240
functions and what i want to do is start

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,760
thinking about the composition of them

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,960
so i'm going to take as the first

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,840
component the value of the function x of

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,039
t

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,120
so you pump t through that and then you

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,760
make that the first component of f and

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,000
the second component will be the value

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,520
of the function y of t

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,360
so the image that you might have in your

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,719
head for something like this is you can

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,640
think of t

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,520
as just living on a number line of some

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,039
kind

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,000
then you have x and y

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,520
which is just a plane so that'll be

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,680
you know your x coordinate your y

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,039
coordinate two dimensional space

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,360
and then you have your output which is

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,199
just whatever the value of f is and for

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,960
this whole function

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,840
for this whole composition of functions

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,920
you're thinking of x t y t as taking a

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,920
single point in t and kind of moving it

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,000
over to two dimensional space somewhere

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,400
and then from there our multivariable

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
function takes that back down so this is

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
just a single variable function

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,880
nothing

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,159
you know nothing too fancy going on in

39
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,680
terms of where you start and where you

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,799
end up it's just what's happening in the

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
middle

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,880
and what i want to know is what's the

43
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,640
derivative of this function

44
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,479
if i take this and it's just an ordinary

45
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
derivative not a partial derivative

46
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,759
because this is a single variable

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,000
function one variable input one variable

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,840
output how do you take its derivative

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
and there's a a special rule for this

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,280
it's called the chain rule the

51
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,600
multivariable chain rule but you don't

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
actually need it so let's actually walk

53
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,479
through this

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
showing that you don't need it it's not

55
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,280
that you'll never need it it's just for

56
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,320
computations like this you could go

57
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,000
without it

58
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,880
it's a very useful theoretical tool a

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,720
very useful model to have in mind for

60
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,759
what function function composition looks

61
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,040
like and

62
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,640
implies for derivatives in the

63
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,479
multivariable world

64
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,079
so let's just start plugging things in

65
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,719
here if i have f of x of t of y of t the

66
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,640
first thing i might do is write okay f

67
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,239
and instead of x of t just write in

68
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,560
cosine of t

69
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,080
since that's the function that i have

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
for x of t

71
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,360
and then y we replace that with sine of

72
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,440
t

73
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,120
sine of t

74
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,840
and of course i'm hoping to take the

75
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,840
derivative of this

76
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,680
and then from there we can go to the

77
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,840
definition of f f of x y equals x

78
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,480
squared times y which means we take that

79
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,239
first component squared so we'll take

80
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,319
that first component

81
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,200
cosine of t

82
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,200
and then square it

83
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,400
square that guy and then we'll multiply

84
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,480
it by the second component

85
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
sine of t

86
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,879
sine of t

87
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840
and again we're just taking this

88
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,200
derivative

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,319
and you might be wondering okay why am i

90
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,040
doing this you're just showing me how to

91
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,959
take a first derivative an ordinary

92
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,319
derivative but the pattern that we'll

93
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,840
see is going to lead us to the

94
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,760
multivariable chain rule and it's

95
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,280
actually kind of surprising when you see

96
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,360
it in this context because it pops out

97
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,959
in a way that you might not expect

98
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
things to pop out

99
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,959
so continuing our chugging along when

100
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,440
you take the derivative of this you do

101
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,640
the product rule lefty right times plus

102
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,560
right d left so in this case the left is

103
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,760
cosine squared of t we just leave that

104
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,319
as it is

105
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,080
cosine squared of t

106
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,840
and multiply it by the derivative of the

107
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,400
right d right so that's going to be

108
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,560
cosine of t

109
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,360
cosine of t

110
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,680
and then we add to that right which is

111
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,920
you know keep that right side

112
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,760
unchanged multiplied by the derivative

113
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,519
of the left and for that we use the

114
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,959
chain rule the the single variable chain

115
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,040
rule where you think of taking the

116
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,200
derivative of the outside so you hope

117
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,799
that plop that 2 down like you're taking

118
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,760
the derivative of 2x but you're just

119
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,920
writing in cosine instead of x

120
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,120
cosine t

121
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,400
and then you multiply that by the

122
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,319
derivative

123
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,159
by the derivative of the inside that's a

124
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,480
tongue twister um

125
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,400
which is negative sine of t

126
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,080
negative sine of t and i'm afraid i'm

127
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,080
gonna run off the edge here

128
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,080
certainly with the many many parentheses

129
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,599
that i need uh i'll i'll go ahead and

130
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
rewrite this though i'm going to rewrite

131
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,600
it anyway because there's a certain

132
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,440
pattern that i

133
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,040
hope to make clear

134
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
so let me just rewrite this side

135
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,680
just copy that down here

136
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,120
i just want to rewrite this guy

137
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,639
you might be wondering why but it'll

138
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,000
become clear in just a moment why i want

139
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,440
to do this

140
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
so in this case

141
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,639
i'm going to write this as

142
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,840
2

143
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,840
times cosine of t

144
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,880
times sine of t

145
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,560
and then all of that multiplied by

146
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,440
negative sine of t

147
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,440
negative sine of t

148
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
so this is the derivative this is the

149
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,039
derivative of the composition of

150
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,560
functions that ultimately was a single

151
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,479
variable function but it kind of went

152
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,160
through two different variables

153
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,639
and i just want to make an observation

154
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,520
in terms of the partial derivatives of f

155
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,759
so

156
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,440
let me just make a copy of this guy

157
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,680
give ourselves a little bit of room down

158
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,680
here

159
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
just paste that over here

160
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,000
so let's look at the partial derivatives

161
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,440
of f for a second here

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,039
so if i took the partial derivative with

163
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,520
respect to x

164
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,840
partial partial x

165
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,680
which means y is treated as a constant

166
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,039
so i take the derivative of x squared to

167
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
get 2x

168
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,320
and then multiply it by that constant

169
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,720
which is just y

170
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,280
and if i also do it with respect to y

171
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,520
get all of them in there

172
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,280
so now y looks like a variable x looks

173
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,960
like a constant so x squared also looks

174
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,360
like a constant constant times a

175
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,600
variable the derivative is just that

176
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,560
constant

177
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,400
these two their pattern comes up in the

178
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,000
ultimate result that we got and this is

179
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,720
the whole reason that i rewrote it if

180
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,360
you look at this 2xy you can see that

181
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,199
over here where cosine corresponds to x

182
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,639
sine corresponds to y based on our

183
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,800
original functions

184
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,199
and then x squared here

185
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
corresponds with squaring the x that we

186
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,400
put in there

187
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,960
then if we take the derivative of our

188
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,440
two intermediary functions the ordinary

189
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,600
derivative of x with respect to t

190
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,919
that's derivative of cosine

191
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,759
negative sine

192
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,759
of t

193
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,520
and then similarly derivative of y just

194
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,960
the ordinary derivative no partials

195
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,800
going on here

196
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,560
with respect to t

197
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,800
that's equal to cosine derivative of

198
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,319
sine is cosine

199
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,880
and these guys show up right you see

200
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,319
negative sine over here

201
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,600
and you see cosine show up over here

202
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,440
and we could generalize this we could

203
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,280
write it down and say at least for this

204
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,520
specific example it looks like the

205
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,599
derivative of the composition is

206
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,759
this part which is the partial of f

207
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,960
with respect to y

208
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,319
right that's kind of what it looks like

209
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,560
here once we've plugged in the

210
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,639
intermediary functions

211
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,440
multiplied by this guy was the ordinary

212
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,160
derivative of y with respect to t

213
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,840
so that was the ordinary derivative of y

214
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,160
with respect to t

215
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,039
and then very similarly this guy was the

216
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,840
partial of f with respect to x

217
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,080
partial x and we're multiplying it by

218
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,319
the ordinary derivative of x of t so

219
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,720
over here x of t

220
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,560
with respect to t

221
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,639
and of course when i write this partial

222
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,639
f partial y what i really mean is you

223
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,960
plug in for x and y

224
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,160
the two coordinate functions x of t y of

225
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,919
t

226
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,759
so if i say partial left partial y over

227
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,840
here what i really mean is you take that

228
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,960
x squared and then you plug in x of t

229
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,479
squared to get cosine cosine squared and

230
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,919
same deal over here you're always

231
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,360
plugging things in so you ultimately

232
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,039
have a function of t

233
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,520
but this right here has a name this is

234
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,199
the multivariable chain rule uh and it's

235
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,919
important enough i'll just kind of i'll

236
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,160
just write it out all on its own here

237
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,520
if we take the ordinary derivative with

238
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,440
respect to t

239
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,759
of a composition of a multivariable

240
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,960
function in this case just two variables

241
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,960
x of t

242
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,520
y of t where we're plugging in two

243
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,080
intermediary functions x of t y of t

244
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,280
each of which just single variable the

245
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,879
result

246
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,879
is that we take the partial derivative

247
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,720
with respect to x

248
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,000
and we multiply it by

249
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,560
the derivative of x with respect to t

250
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:37,039
and then we add to that

251
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,039
the partial derivative with respect to y

252
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,880
multiplied by the derivative of y with

253
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,880
respect to t

254
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,200
so this entire expression here

255
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,600
is what you might call the simple

256
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,920
version of the multivariable chain rule

257
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,920
and you get there's a more general

258
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,600
version and we'll kind of build up to it

259
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,839
but this is the simplest example you can

260
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,920
think of where you you start with one

261
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,440
dimension and then you move over to two

262
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,120
dimensions somehow and then you move

263
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,120
from those two dimensions down to one

264
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,640
so this is this is that and in the next

265
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,399
video i'm going to talk about the

266
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,839
intuition for why this is true you know

267
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,600
here i just went through an example and

268
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,360
showed oh it just happens to be true it

269
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,519
fills this pattern but there's a very

270
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,800
nice line of reasoning for where this

271
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,000
comes about

272
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,480
and i'll also talk about a more

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
generalized form where you'll see it we

274
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,000
start using vector notation it makes

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
things look very clean

276
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,320
and i might even get around to a more

277
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,920
formal argument for why this is true

278
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,920
so see you next video
