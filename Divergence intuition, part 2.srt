00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,333
- [Voiceover] Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,560
So, in the last video I was
talking about divergence

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,480
and kind of laying down the
intuition that we need for it.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,400
Where you're imagining a
vector field as representing

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,900
some kind of fluid flow
where particles move

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,920
according to the vector
that they're attached to

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,420
in that point in time and as they move

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,060
to a different point the
vector they're attached to

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,300
is different so their
velocity changes in some way.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,241
And the key question that
we want to think about is

11
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:24,200
"If you have a given
point somewhere in space,

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,500
"does fluid tend to
flow towards that point

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,200
"or does it tend to
flow more away from it?"

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,580
Does it diverge away from that point?

15
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,940
And what I wanna do here
is start kinda closing

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,400
our grasp on that intuition
a little bit more tightly,

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,300
as if we are trying to
discover the formula for

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,140
divergence ourselves, because
ultimately that's what

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,760
I'm gonna get to, a
formula for divergence.

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,340
But I want it to be
something that's not just

21
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,100
plopped down in front of
you, but something that you

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,640
actually, you know,
feel deep in your bones.

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,520
So a vector field like the
one I have pictured above

24
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,601
is given as a function, a
multi-variable function,

25
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,041
with a two-dimensional input,

26
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,360
since it's a two-dimensional vector field,

27
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,841
and then some kinda
two-dimensional output.

28
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:05,924
And it's common to write
P and Q as the functions

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,601
for these, the components of the output.

30
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:12,960
So P and Q are each just
scalar value functions

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,360
and you think of them as the components of

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,940
your vector valued output.

33
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,860
And the divergence is
kinda like a derivative,

34
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,540
where you might denote it by just div,

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,900
and in the same way that your
derivative, you have this

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,241
operator and what it does
is it takes in a function.

37
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:27,880
And what you get is a whole new function.

38
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,200
This div operator you
think of as taking in

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,320
a vector field of some kind
and you get a new function.

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,681
And the new function you
get will be scalar valued,

41
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,780
it'll be something that just
takes in points in space

42
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,220
and outputs a number,
because what you're thinking,

43
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,740
the thing that it's trying to do

44
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,780
is take in some specific
point with XY coordinates

45
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,020
and just give you a
single number to tell you

46
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,820
"Hey, does fluid tend
to diverge away from it?

47
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,200
"How much, or does it tend to
flow towards it and how much?"

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,480
So this is the kind of, the form

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,381
of the thing that we're going for.

50
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,062
So here what we're gonna
do is just start thinking

51
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:03,561
about cases where this divergence
is positive, or negative,

52
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:05,561
or zero and what that should look like.

53
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:08,881
So for example, let's say we
want cases where the divergence

54
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:13,048
of our vector field at a
specific point XY is positive.

55
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:17,341
What might that look like?

56
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:20,121
So one case would be where your
point, nothing is happening

57
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:22,301
at that point and the vector
attached to it is zero,

58
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,241
and everyone around it is going away.

59
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:28,342
This is kinda the extreme
example of positive divergence.

60
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:31,222
And I animated this in the
last video where we have

61
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:33,921
you know, all of the vectors
pointing away from the origin

62
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,901
and if you look at a
region around that origin,

63
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:38,421
all the fluid particles
kinda go out of that region.

64
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:42,841
And that's the quintessential
positive divergence example.

65
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,061
But it doesn't have to look like that.

66
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:46,621
It actually, I mean, you
could have something where

67
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:50,001
there is a little bit of
movement at your point

68
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:52,381
and then maybe there's
movement towards it as well

69
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,201
from one side, and vectors
are kind of going towards it,

70
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:58,901
but they're going away
from it even more rapidly

71
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:01,261
on the other side, so if
you think of any kind of

72
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:03,462
actual region around your
point, you're saying,

73
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:05,821
"Sure, fluid is going into
that region a little bit,

74
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:07,701
"but it's much more
counterbalanced by how quickly

75
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:08,921
it's going out."

76
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,201
So these are the kind of
situations you might see

77
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,041
for positive divergence.

78
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,621
Now negative divergence,
negative divergence.

79
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:18,263
Let's think about what examples
of that might look like.

80
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:21,103
Divergence of V at a given point

81
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:22,703
and you know, really it's
something that takes in

82
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,064
all points of the plane
but we're just looking

83
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:28,684
at specific points, so if
the divergence is negative,

84
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:30,344
well the quintessential
example here is that

85
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,604
nothing happens at your
point, but all of the vectors

86
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:35,724
around it are kind of
flowing in towards it.

87
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:36,985
And this is the thing where I animated,

88
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,544
where we took this and we
flipped all of the vectors.

89
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:41,624
And said, "Ah, there, if you
start playing the fluid flow,

90
00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:44,084
"then the density in any
region around the origin

91
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:46,084
"you know, increases a lot,
all of the fluid particles

92
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:49,364
"tend to converge towards that center."

93
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:51,464
But again, this isn't the only
example that you might have.

94
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:55,345
You could have a little bit of
activity at your point itself

95
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,584
and maybe it is the case that
things do flow away from it

96
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,065
a little bit as you're going away.

97
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:00,904
And some of the fluid
particles are going away,

98
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:03,025
and it's just the case
that the fluid particles

99
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:05,104
flowing in towards it
from another direction

100
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:07,024
heavily counterbalance that.

101
00:04:07,024 --> 00:04:08,824
Cuz then if you're looking
at any kind of region

102
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:11,384
around your point, you say
fluid particles are coming in

103
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,764
quite rapidly, a lot
of particles per time,

104
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:16,244
but they're not leaving too
rapidly round the other end.

105
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:18,564
So kind of loosely,
intuitively, this is what a

106
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:21,224
negative divergence case might look like.

107
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:23,785
And finally, another case that
we wanna start thinking about

108
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:26,305
as we're tightening our
grasp on this intuition

109
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:28,604
is what happens, or
what does it look like,

110
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:32,024
if the divergence of your
function at a specific point

111
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:36,064
is zero, right, if it's
just absolutely zero?

112
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,144
And one thing this could
look like is, you know,

113
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,944
you have something going on
but nothing really changes

114
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:44,344
and all of the fluid just kinda
flows in then it flows out

115
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:46,761
and on the whole it balances.

116
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:48,705
You know, if you take any kind of region

117
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,885
the amount flowing in is balanced

118
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:51,785
with the amount flowing out.

119
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:54,705
But it could also look like
you have fluid flowing in

120
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:58,346
kind of from one dimension,
but it's cancelled out

121
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:01,185
by flowing away from the point in a manner

122
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:04,005
that sort of perfectly balances
it in another direction.

123
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:05,625
So these are the loose pictures
that I want you to have

124
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,066
in the back of your
mind as we start looking

125
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,545
for the actual formula for divergence.

126
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:12,185
And what I'll do in the next video or two,

127
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:14,485
is start looking at
these functions P and Q

128
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:16,785
and thinking about the
partial derivative properties

129
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:19,285
that they have that will
correspond with, you know,

130
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,905
these positive divergence
images that you should have

131
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,805
in your head, or the
negative divergence images

132
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:25,365
that you should have in your head.

133
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:27,699
So with that, I'll see you next video.
