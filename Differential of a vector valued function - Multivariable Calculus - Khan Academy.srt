1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,680
in the last couple of videos we saw that

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,320
we can describe a curve by a position

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,800
vector valued function and in very

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,200
general terms it would be the x position

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,360
as a function of time times the unit

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
vector in the horizontal direction

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,960
plus the

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,119
y position is a function of time times

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,880
the unit vector in the vertical

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,519
direction and this will essentially

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,439
describe this though if you can imagine

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,679
a particle and let's say the parameter t

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,160
represents time it'll describe where the

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,079
particle is at any given time if we

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,079
wanted a particular curve we can say

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,079
well this is only applies for

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,360
let's say for some curve we're dealing

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,239
it's r of

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,640
t

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,559
and it's only applicable between

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,160
t being greater than a and less than b

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,640
and you know that would describe some

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,559
curve in two dimensions let me just draw

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,800
it here this is all a review of really

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,480
the last two videos

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,640
so this curve you know it might look

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,359
something like that where this is where

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,879
t is equal to a that's where t is equal

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,760
to b and when you know so r of a will be

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,000
this vector right here that ends at

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,439
that point and then as t or if you can

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
imagine the parameter being time it

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,600
doesn't have to be time that's a

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,280
convenient one to visualize these each

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,880
corresponding as t gets larger and

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,840
larger we're just going to different

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,240
we're specifying different points on the

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
path we saw that two videos ago and in

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,479
the last video

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
we

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,640
thought about well what does it mean to

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,560
take the derivative of a vector-valued

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,240
function and we came up with this idea

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,079
that and it wasn't an idea we actually

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,320
showed it to be true we came up with a

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,799
definition really that the derivative i

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,000
could call it r prime of t

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,520
and it's going to be a vector the

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,280
derivative of a vector valued function

50
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,520
is once again going to be a derivative

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,040
but it is equal to the way we defined it

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,119
x prime of t

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,240
times i plus y time prime of t

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,360
times j or another way to write that and

55
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,479
i'll just write all the different ways

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,920
just so you get familiar with dr

57
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,079
dt

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,240
is equal to dx

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,720
dt this is a just a standard derivative

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,479
it's x of t is a scalar function so this

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,160
is a standard derivative

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,040
times

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,879
i plus d y

64
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,599
dt times

65
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,200
j and if we wanted to think about the

66
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,959
differential one thing that we can think

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,319
about and you know whenever i do the

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,160
work the math with the differential it's

69
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,599
a little bit hand wavy i'm not being

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,360
very rigorous but if you imagine

71
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,239
multiplying both sides of this equation

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,840
by a very small dt

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,720
or this exact dt you would get

74
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,480
dr

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,680
is equal to i'll just leave it like this

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,400
dx

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,319
dt times dt i could make these cancel

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,480
out but i'll just write it like this

79
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,440
first times the unit vector i plus d y

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,879
dt

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,760
times the unit vec times dt

82
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,120
times the unit vector j or we could

83
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,879
rewrite this and i'm just rewriting it

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,800
in all of the different ways that one

85
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,200
can rewrite it you could also write this

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,200
as dr is equal to

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,040
x prime of t

88
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,959
x prime of t

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,519
dt

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,440
times the unit vector i sorry this was x

91
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,879
prime of

92
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,599
t

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,879
dt right this is x prime of t right

94
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,239
there times the unit vector i plus

95
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,120
y prime

96
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,720
of t that's just that right there times

97
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,720
dt times the unit vector j and just to i

98
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,920
guess complete the trifecta the other

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,599
way that we could write this is that dr

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,519
is equal to if we just allowed these to

101
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,879
cancel out then we get is equal to dx

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,799
times i

103
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,360
plus dy

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,040
times dy times j and that actually makes

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,879
a lot of intuitive sense that if i look

106
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
at any dr so let's say i look at the

107
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,599
change between

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,360
this vector and this vector

109
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,280
let's say the super small change right

110
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,280
there that is our

111
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,519
dr and it's made up of it's our dx our

112
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,360
change in x is that right there you

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,200
could imagine it's that right there

114
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,720
times but we're vectorizing it by

115
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,640
multiplying it by the unit vector in the

116
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,120
horizontal direction plus d y

117
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,720
d y times the unit vector in the

118
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
vertical direction so when you multiply

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,160
this distance times the unit vector

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,840
you're essentially getting this vector

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,680
you're essentially getting this vector

122
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,360
right here and when you multiply this

123
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,040
guy and actually our change in y here is

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,560
negative you're going to get this vector

125
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,840
right here

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,960
so when you add those together you get

127
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,280
your change in your actual position

128
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,120
vector so that was all a little bit of

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,520
background and this might be

130
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,120
somewhat useful in a future video from

131
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,440
now actually i'm going to leave it there

132
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,880
because what i really i just wanted to

133
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,199
introduce this notation and get you

134
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,120
familiar with it in the next video what

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,800
i'm going to do is give you a little bit

136
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,960
more intuition for what exactly what

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,440
exactly does this thing mean and how

138
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,199
does it change depending on different

139
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
parameterizations and i'll do it with

140
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,759
two different parameterizations for the

141
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,759
same curve
