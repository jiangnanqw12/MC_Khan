1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:01,538
- So I have here

2
00:00:01,538 --> 00:00:03,314
a very complicated function.

3
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:05,149
It's got a two-dimensional input,

4
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:07,212
two different coordinates to its input,

5
00:00:07,212 --> 00:00:09,809
and then a three-dimensional output.

6
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,827
Specifically, it's a
three-dimensional vector,

7
00:00:11,827 --> 00:00:13,804
and each one of these is some expression,

8
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,957
its a bunch of cosines and sines

9
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:18,171
that depends on the two input coordinates.

10
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:20,325
And in the last video, we talked about how

11
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:22,668
to visualize functions
that have a single input,

12
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:24,553
a single parameter

13
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:25,386
like T,

14
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:28,752
and then, a two-dimensional vector output.

15
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:30,214
So some kind of expression of T

16
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:31,735
and another expression of T.

17
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:34,658
And this is sort of the
three-dimensional analog of that.

18
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:35,532
So what we're going to do,

19
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:38,139
we're just going to visualize
things in the output space,

20
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,897
and we're gonna try to think of all

21
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:42,601
the possible points that could be outputs.

22
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,553
So, for example, let's
just start off simple,

23
00:00:44,553 --> 00:00:46,991
let's get a feel for this function

24
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:51,429
by evaluating it at a
simple pair of points.

25
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:53,276
So, let's say

26
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,958
we evaluate this function F,

27
00:00:55,958 --> 00:01:00,125
at T equals zero, I think will
probably be pretty simple,

28
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:03,443
and then S is equal to pi.

29
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,970
So let's think about what this would be.

30
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,803
We go up and we say,

31
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:13,673
okay, T of zero, cosine of zero is one,

32
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,745
so this whole thing is gonna be one,

33
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:18,328
same with this one.

34
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:22,868
And sine of zero is zero.

35
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:25,050
So this over here's gonna be zero,

36
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,633
and this is also gonna be zero.

37
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:31,272
Now cosine of pi is negative one.

38
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:34,791
So this here's gonna be negative one.

39
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,647
This one here's also
gonna be negative one.

40
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:40,512
And then sine of pi,
just like sine of zero,

41
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:41,861
is zero.

42
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:46,145
So this whole thing actually
ends up simplifying quite a bit

43
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:50,592
so that the top is three
times one plus negative one,

44
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,485
one times negative one is negative one,

45
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:53,735
and we get two.

46
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:58,135
Then we have three times zero plus zero,

47
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:00,031
so the Y component is just zero,

48
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:02,690
and then the Z component is also zero.

49
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,571
So what that would mean

50
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:07,125
is that this output is gonna be the point

51
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,349
that's two along the x-axis,

52
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,084
and, there's nothing else to it,

53
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:12,965
it's just two along the x-axis.

54
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:14,683
So go ahead and--whoop,

55
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:15,728
move the graph about,

56
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:18,150
add that point there.

57
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,222
So that's what would correspond

58
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,342
to this one particular input, zero and pi.

59
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,932
And, you know you can do
this with a whole bunch,

60
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:25,689
and you might add a couple of other points

61
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:28,121
based on other inputs that you find.

62
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:29,567
But this would take forever,

63
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,669
to start to get a feel for
the function as a whole.

64
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:33,270
And another thing you can do, is say,

65
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,959
okay, maybe rather than thinking of

66
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,799
evaluating at a particular point,

67
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:41,252
imagine one of the inputs was constant.

68
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:45,514
So let's imagine that S
stayed constant at pi.

69
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:47,110
But then we let T range freely.

70
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,944
So, that means we're gonna have some kind

71
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:51,027
of different output here.

72
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:54,318
And, we're gonna let T

73
00:02:57,563 --> 00:03:00,579
just be some kind of variable
while the output is pi.

74
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:03,378
So what that means is
we keep all of these,

75
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:05,026
these negative one, negative one, and zero

76
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:06,949
for what sine of pi is.

77
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:09,250
But the output now

78
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,750
is gonna be three cosine of T,

79
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:14,487
cosine of T,

80
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:19,010
plus negative one times the cosine of T,

81
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,927
so it's gonna be minus cosine of T.

82
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:28,429
The next part is gonna
still be three sine of T,

83
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:30,264
this is no longer zero.

84
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:34,822
I should probably erase
those guys actually so...

85
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:37,401
We're no longer evaluating

86
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:41,899
(inaudible) when T was zero.

87
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:43,969
So, three times sine of T,

88
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:47,504
that's just still the function
that we're dealing with.

89
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:48,337
Three,

90
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:51,052
sine of T,

91
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:57,960
and then minus one times sine of T.

92
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,043
So minus sine

93
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:01,277
of T.

94
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,077
Keep drawing it in green
just to be consistent.

95
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:09,749
And then the bottom stays at zero.

96
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,189
And this whole thing actually simplifies,

97
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,803
three cosine T minus cosine T,

98
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:14,886
that's just two cosine T.

99
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,570
And then the same deal for the other one.

100
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,163
It's gonna be two sine of T.

101
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:21,830
So this whole thing,

102
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,554
actually simplifies down

103
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:29,297
to this.
So this is again

104
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:30,647
when we're letting S stay constant

105
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:32,845
and T ranges freely.

106
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:34,595
And when you do that,

107
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,357
what you're gonna end up getting

108
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:37,361
is a circle that you draw.

109
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,849
And you can maybe see why it's a circle

110
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:41,452
'cause you have this cosine/sine pattern.

111
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:42,780
It's a circle with radius two,

112
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,613
and it should make sense that

113
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:46,302
it runs through that first
point that we evaluated.

114
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:47,177
So that's what happens if you let

115
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:49,003
just one of the variables run.

116
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,791
But now let's do the same thing,

117
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,952
but think instead of what happens

118
00:04:51,952 --> 00:04:54,702
is S varies and T stays constant.

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,105
I encourage you to work
it out for yourself,

120
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:00,311
I'll go ahead and just kind of draw it,

121
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:04,144
because I kinda wanna
give the intuition here.

122
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:06,958
So in that case you're gonna get a circle

123
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,708
that looks like this.

124
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:10,875
So again I encourage you to try

125
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,108
to think through for the same reasons.

126
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:14,263
Imagine that you let S run freely,

127
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:16,375
keep T constant at zero.

128
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,028
Why is that you would get a circle

129
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:19,328
that looks like this?

130
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:23,328
And in fact, if you let
both T and S run freely,

131
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:26,747
a very nice way to visualize that

132
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:28,303
is to imagine that this circle,

133
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:30,032
which represents S running freely,

134
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:33,321
sweeps throughout space
as you let T run freely.

135
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:38,310
And what you're gonna end
up getting when you do that,

136
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,930
is a shape that goes like this.

137
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,482
This is a doughnut. We have a fancy word

138
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:47,136
for this in mathematics
we call it a torus.

139
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:49,027
But it turns out the function here

140
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:51,546
is a fancy way of drawing the torus.

141
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:54,332
And in another video I'm gonna
go through in more detail

142
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:55,481
if you were just given the torus,

143
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,049
how you can find this function,

144
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:59,272
how you can kind of get the
intuitive feel for that.

145
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:01,069
And in that it'll involve going through,

146
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,235
in a bit more detail,

147
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:03,917
why when you sweep the circle out

148
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:06,136
it gets the torus just so.

149
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:07,209
And what the relationship between

150
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,061
this red circle and the blue circle is.

151
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:10,122
But here I just kind of want to give

152
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:13,136
an intuition for what parametric
surfaces are all about,

153
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:14,648
how it's a way of visualizing something

154
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:17,468
that has a two-dimensional input

155
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:20,135
and a three-dimensional output.
