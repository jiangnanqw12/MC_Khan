00:00:00,526 --> 00:00:01,573
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,573 --> 00:00:03,683
So what I'd like to do here is to describe

3
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:06,220
how we think about
three-dimensional graphs.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,858
Three-dimensional graphs
are a way that we represent

5
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:10,255
certain kind of multi-variable function

6
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:12,156
that kind of has two inputs,

7
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:14,539
or rather a two-dimensional input,

8
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:17,003
and then one-dimensional
of output of some kind.

9
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:19,302
So the one that I have pictured here

10
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:23,733
is f of (x, y) equals x
squared plus y squared.

11
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:26,618
And before talking
exactly about this graph,

12
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:28,463
I think it would be helpful, by analogy,

13
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:30,380
we take a look at the
two-dimensional graphs and

14
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,580
kinda remind ourselves how those work,

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,562
what it is that we do,
because, it's pretty much

16
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:38,876
the same thing in three-dimensions,

17
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:41,148
but it takes a little bit
more of visualization.

18
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:43,365
So the two-dimensional graphs,

19
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:45,559
they have some kind of function, you know,

20
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,726
let's see you have f of
x is equal to x squared,

21
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:54,000
and anytime you visualizing
a function, you trying to

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,554
understand the relationship between

23
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,154
the inputs and the outputs.

24
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:59,032
And here those are both just numbers,

25
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:00,873
so you know you input a number like two,

26
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:03,646
and it's gonna output four,

27
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:07,351
you know you input negative
one it's gonna output one.

28
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:09,638
And you're trying to
understand all the possible

29
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:11,506
input-output pairs.

30
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,089
And the fact that we can do this,

31
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:17,571
that we can get a pretty
good intuitive feel for

32
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:21,376
every possible input-output
pair is pretty incredible,

33
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:24,476
the way we go about this
with graphs is you think

34
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:26,492
we just plotting these
actual pairs, right?

35
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:30,189
So you're gonna plot the
point, let's say we are gonna

36
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:34,306
plot the point (2,4), so we
may kind of mark our graph,

37
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:36,973
two here, one, two, three, four,

38
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:43,261
so you wanna mark somewhere here (2,4),

39
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:45,862
and that represents an input-output pair.

40
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:48,300
And if you do that with,
you know, negative one, one,

41
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,383
you go negative one, one.

42
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:55,302
And when you do this for every
possible input-output pair,

43
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:59,159
what you end up getting, I
might not draw this super well,

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,491
is some kind of smooth curve.

45
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:04,232
The implication for doing this
is that we typically think of

46
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:07,406
what is on the x-axis as
being where the inputs live,

47
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:09,813
you know, this would be, we
think of as the input one,

48
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:13,018
and this is the input two, and so on,

49
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:17,185
and then you think of the
output as being the height

50
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:21,554
of the graph above each point.

51
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:23,272
But this is kind of a
consequence of the fact

52
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:26,078
where we just listing
all of the pairs here.

53
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:29,149
Now if we go to the world
of multi-variable functions,

54
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,905
you know, not gonna show
the graph right now,

55
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:34,122
let's just think we've got
three-dimensional space

56
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:37,106
at out disposal to do with what we will.

57
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,010
We still want to understand
the relationship between

58
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,653
inputs and outputs of
this guy, but this case,

59
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:46,820
inputs are something that we
think of as pair of points,

60
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:51,391
we might have a pair of points like (1,2),

61
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:53,654
and the output there is gonna be

62
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:57,821
one squared plus two squared,
and that equals is five.

63
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,328
So how do we visualize that?

64
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:08,053
Well if we wanna pair these
things together, the natural way

65
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:10,813
to do that is to think of
a triplet of some kind.

66
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:14,980
So in this case, you wanna
plug the triplet (1, 2, 5),

67
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:19,932
and to do that in three-dimensions,

68
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:23,157
we'll take a look over
here, we think of going one

69
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:25,938
in the x direction, this
axis here is the x-axis,

70
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:28,276
so we want to move distance one there,

71
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:31,700
and we want to go two in the y direction,

72
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,610
so we kinda think of
going distance two there,

73
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,442
and then five up, and then

74
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:40,120
that's gonna give us some
kind of point, right?

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,489
So we think this point in space

76
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,043
and that's a given input-output pair.

77
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:45,807
But we could do this for a lot, right,

78
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:48,571
a couple different
points that you might get

79
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:51,183
if you start plotting
various different ones,

80
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:54,014
look something like this,
and of course there is

81
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,244
infinitely many that you can
do and it'll take forever

82
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:58,926
if you try to just draw each
one in three-dimensions,

83
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:02,042
but what's really nice here
is that you know get rid of

84
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,567
those lines, if you imagine doing this

85
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:07,289
for all of the infinite
many pairs of inputs

86
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,892
that you could possibly have,
you end up drawing a surface.

87
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:14,952
So in this case the surface
kind of looks like a

88
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:17,215
three-dimensional parabola,
that's no coincidence,

89
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,038
it has to do with the
fact that we are using

90
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:21,331
x squared and y squared here.

91
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:25,498
And now the inputs like (1,
2), we think of as being

92
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:29,301
on the xy-plane, right?

93
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:31,658
So you think of the inputs living here,

94
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:33,818
and then what corresponds
to the output is that

95
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:37,463
height of a giving point
above the graph, right?

96
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,564
So it's very similar to
two-dimensions, you think,

97
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:42,084
you know, we think of the
inputs as being on one axis,

98
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:44,417
and the height gives the output there.

99
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,936
So just to give an example of

100
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:49,283
what the consequence of this
is, I want you to think about

101
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:52,522
what might happen if we change
our multi-variable function

102
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:56,690
a little bit, and we multiply
everything by half, right?

103
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,857
So I'll draw in red here, let's
see that we have a function,

104
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:06,452
but I'm gonna change it so
that it outputs one half

105
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,227
of x squared plus y squared.

106
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:13,394
What's gonna be the shape of
the graph for that function?

107
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:15,919
And what it means is the
height of every point

108
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,645
above this xy-plane is gonna
have to get cut in half.

109
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:21,392
So it's actually just the modification

110
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:23,420
of what we already have,
but everything kind of

111
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,181
sloops on down to be
about half of what it was.

112
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:29,386
So in this case instead
of that height being five,

113
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:31,531
it'll be two-point-five.

114
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,442
You could imagine, let's
say we did this, you know,

115
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,823
is even more extreme,
instead of saying one-half,

116
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:38,725
you cut it down by like one-twelfth,

117
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:42,558
maybe I'll use the same
color, by one-twelfth,

118
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,017
that would mean that everything, you know,

119
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:49,259
sloops very flat, very flat
and close to the xy-plane.

120
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,443
So the graph being very
close to xy-plane like this

121
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:54,909
corresponds to very small outputs.

122
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,287
And one thing that I'd like
to caution you against,

123
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,563
it's very tempting to try to think of

124
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:01,520
every multi-variable function as a graph,

125
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,687
cause we are so used to
graphs in two-dimensions

126
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:06,726
and we are so used to
trying to find analogies

127
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:09,781
between two-dimensions and
three-dimensions directly,

128
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:12,734
but the only reason that
this works is because

129
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:15,376
if you take the number of
dimension in the input,

130
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,515
two-dimensions, and then
the number of dimensions

131
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:19,926
in the output, one-dimension,
it was reasonable

132
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:23,281
to fit all of that into
three, which we could do.

133
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:25,104
But imagine if you have
a multi-variable function

134
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:27,044
with, you know, a three-dimensional input,

135
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:29,156
and a two-dimensional
output, that would require

136
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,420
a five-dimensional graph,
but we are not very good

137
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,899
at visualizing things like that.

138
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,586
So there's lots of other
methods, and I think

139
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:37,883
it's very important to
kinda of open you mind

140
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:39,752
to what those might be.

141
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:42,940
In particular, another one
that I'm gonna go through soon,

142
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,613
lets us think about 3-D graphs but kind of

143
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,709
in a two-dimensional setting,
and we are just gonna

144
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,093
look at the input space,
that's called a contour map.

145
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,194
Couple of other ones,
like parametric functions,

146
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:54,216
you just look in the output space;

147
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:55,616
things like vector space,

148
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:59,210
you kind of look at the input
space but get all the outputs.

149
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,770
There's lots of different
ways, I'll go over those

150
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,301
in the next few videos.

151
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:05,409
And that's three-dimensional graphs.
