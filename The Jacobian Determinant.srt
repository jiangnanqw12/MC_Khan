1
00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:01,563
- [Voiceover] In this
video, I want to talk about

2
00:00:01,563 --> 00:00:04,192
something called the Jacobian determinant.

3
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:05,861
And it's, more or less,
just what it sounds like.

4
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:08,210
It's the determinant
of the Jacobian matrix

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,484
that I've been talking to you

6
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:11,428
the last couple videos about.

7
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,467
And before we jump into it,

8
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:13,587
I just want to give a quick review

9
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:15,710
of how you think about
the determinant itself,

10
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,568
just in an ordinary
linear algebra context.

11
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:23,532
So if I'm taking the determinant
of some kind of matrix,

12
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:26,282
let's say, three, zero, one, two,

13
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:30,312
something like this,

14
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:31,775
to compute the determinant,

15
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:33,916
you take these diagonal terms here,

16
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:37,995
so you take three multiplied by that two,

17
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:40,704
and then you subtract
off the other diagonal,

18
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,699
subtract off one multiplied by zero.

19
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:47,097
And in this case, that evaluates to six.

20
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:47,930
But there is, of course,

21
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,435
much more than just a
computation going on here.

22
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:52,674
There's a really nice geometric intuition.

23
00:00:52,674 --> 00:00:55,721
Namely, if we think of this
matrix, three, zero, one, two,

24
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,488
as a linear transformation,

25
00:00:57,488 --> 00:01:00,041
as something that's gonna
take this first basis vector

26
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,003
over to the coordinates three, zero,

27
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:03,321
and that second basis vector

28
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:05,270
over to the coordinates one, two,

29
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,908
you know, thinking about the columns,

30
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:09,203
you can think of the
determinant as measuring

31
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:13,655
how much this transformation
stretches or squishes space.

32
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:14,913
And in particular,

33
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:17,800
you'll notice how I have this
yellow region highlighted,

34
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,689
and this region starts
off as the unit square,

35
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:23,610
a square with side lengths
one so its area is one.

36
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,694
And there's nothing special
about this particular region.

37
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:28,138
It's just nice as a canonical shape,

38
00:01:28,138 --> 00:01:29,698
with an area of one,

39
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,131
so that we can compare it to what happens

40
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:32,441
after the transformation.

41
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:35,368
Ask, how much does that
area get stretched out?

42
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:36,378
And the answer is,

43
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:39,759
it gets stretched out by a
factor of the determinant.

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,767
That's kind of what the determinant means,

45
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:44,409
is that all areas, if you were
to draw up any kind of shape,

46
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:45,796
not just that one square,

47
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:48,297
are gonna get stretched
out by a factor of six.

48
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:49,400
And we can actually verify,

49
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,424
looking at this parallelogram
that the square turned into.

50
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:54,381
It has a base of three

51
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,099
and then the height is two.

52
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,833
And three times two is six.

53
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,832
And that has everything
to do with the fact that

54
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:03,443
this three showed up here
and this two showed up there.

55
00:02:03,443 --> 00:02:05,003
So now, let's think about
what this might mean

56
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:07,152
in the context of what
I've been describing

57
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:08,789
in the last couple videos.

58
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,500
And if you'll remember, we
had a multivariable function,

59
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,623
something that you can write out as f one

60
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:17,013
with two inputs

61
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,232
and then the second component,

62
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:20,565
f two, also with two inputs.

63
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:24,118
And the function that I was looking at,

64
00:02:24,118 --> 00:02:27,373
that we were kind of analyzing
to learn about the Jacobian,

65
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:30,853
had the first component, x plus sine of y,

66
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:31,979
x plus sine y,

67
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,146
and the second component
was y plus the sine of x.

68
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:40,330
And the idea was that this
function is not at all linear.

69
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,078
It's gonna make everything
very curvy and complicated.

70
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:45,684
However, if we zoom in
around a particular region,

71
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:49,069
which is what this outer yellow
box represents, zooming in,

72
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,133
it will look like a linear transformation.

73
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,112
In fact, I can kind of play this forward,

74
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:55,405
and we see that even
though everything is crazy,

75
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:56,850
inside that zoomed in version,

76
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,821
things loosely look
like a linear function.

77
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:03,248
And you'll notice I have this
inner yellow box highlighted,

78
00:03:03,248 --> 00:03:05,684
and this yellow box inside
corresponds to the unit square

79
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:07,546
that I was showing in the last animation.

80
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:10,415
And again, it's just a
placeholder as something to watch

81
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:14,136
to see how much the area of
any kind of blob in that region

82
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:15,920
gets stretched.

83
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,940
So, in this particular case,

84
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,368
when you play out the animation,

85
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:20,134
areas don't really change that much.

86
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:21,705
They get stretched out a little bit,

87
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:24,233
but it's not that dramatic.

88
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:27,162
So, if we know the matrix that
describes the transformation

89
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:29,083
that this looks like zoomed in,

90
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,100
the determinant of that
matrix will tell us

91
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,274
the factor by which areas
tend to get stretched out.

92
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:36,990
And in particular, you can
think of this little yellow box

93
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,495
and the factor by which it gets stretched.

94
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:40,328
And as a reminder,

95
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:43,177
the matrix describing that
zoomed in transformation

96
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:44,412
is the Jacobian.

97
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:46,306
It is this thing that kind of holds

98
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:48,860
all of the partial
differential information.

99
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,854
You take the partial derivative of f,

100
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:53,173
with respect to x,

101
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:55,819
sorry, partial of f one
of that first component,

102
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,279
and then the partial derivative
of the second component,

103
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,189
with respect to x,

104
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:03,040
and then on the other column,

105
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,020
we have the partial derivative
of that first component,

106
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,046
with respect to y,

107
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:11,121
and the partial derivative
of that second component,

108
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:12,621
with respect to y.

109
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:14,622
And if you...

110
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,962
Let's see, I'm gonna close this off.

111
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:18,529
Close off this matrix.

112
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,136
And if you evaluate each one
of these partial derivatives

113
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,410
at a particular point,

114
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,083
at whatever point we happen to zoom in on,

115
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,330
in this case, it was negative two, one,

116
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,726
once you plug that into all of these,

117
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,123
you get some matrix that's
just full of numbers.

118
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:34,096
And what turns out to
be a very useful thing

119
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:36,396
later on in multivariable calc concepts,

120
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:39,130
is to take the determinant of that matrix,

121
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,696
to kind of analyze how much
space is getting stretched

122
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:44,285
or squished in that region.

123
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,704
So in the last video, we worked this out

124
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:47,900
for this specific example here,

125
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,214
where that top left function
turned out just to be

126
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:52,795
the constant function, one, right,

127
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,923
because we were taking the
partial derivative of this guy

128
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:56,986
with respect to x and that was one.

129
00:04:56,986 --> 00:04:59,859
And likewise, in the bottom right,

130
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:02,168
that was also a constant function of one.

131
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,515
And then the others were cosine functions.

132
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:06,778
This one was cosine x

133
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:08,361
because we were taking
the partial derivative

134
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:11,678
of this second component
here with respect to x.

135
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,818
And then the top right of our matrix

136
00:05:13,818 --> 00:05:15,151
was cosine of y.

137
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:18,869
And these are, in general,
functions of x and y

138
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:20,351
because you know, you're gonna plug in

139
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:22,765
whatever the input point
you're zooming in on.

140
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:24,304
And when we're thinking
about the determinant here,

141
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:26,137
let's just go ahead and
take the determinant

142
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:28,808
in this form, in the form as a function.

143
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:32,488
So I'm going to ask about the
determinant of this matrix,

144
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:36,065
or maybe you think of it as
a matrix-valued function.

145
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:37,678
And in this case, we do the same thing.

146
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:39,919
I mean, procedurally, you know
how to take a determinant.

147
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,765
We take these diagonals,

148
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:45,020
so that's just gonna be one times one,

149
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,522
and then we subtract off the
product of the other diagonal,

150
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:50,522
subtract off cosine of x

151
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:54,671
multiplied by cosine of y.

152
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,239
And as an example, let's
plug in this point here

153
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,426
that we're zooming in
on, negative two, one.

154
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:04,580
So I'm going to plug in x
is equal to negative two,

155
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,140
and y is equal to one.

156
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,518
And when you plug in
cosine of negative two,

157
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:13,685
that's gonna come out to be
approximately negative 0.42.

158
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:17,961
And when you plug in cosine of y,

159
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,445
cosine of one in this case,

160
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:23,695
that's gonna come out to be about 0.54.

161
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:28,613
And when we multiply those,

162
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:31,805
when we take one minus
the product of those,

163
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:34,722
it's gonna be about negative 0.227.

164
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:39,499
And that's all stuff that you
can plug into your calculator

165
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,572
if you want.

166
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:42,767
And what that means is
that the total determinant,

167
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:45,423
evaluated at that point,
the Jacobian determinant

168
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:48,006
at the point negative two, one,

169
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:50,873
is about 1.227.

170
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,334
So that's telling you that
areas tend to get stretched out

171
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,932
by this factor around that point.

172
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:00,345
And that kind of lines
up with what we see.

173
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:03,750
We see that areas get stretched
out maybe a little bit,

174
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,045
but not that much, right?

175
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,596
It's only by a factor of about 1.2.

176
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:09,442
And now, let's contrast this.

177
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:12,007
If instead we zoom in at the
point where x is equal to zero

178
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,418
and y is equal to one,

179
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:15,838
so I'm gonna go over here
and all I'm gonna change,

180
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,195
all I'm gonna change is
that x is equal to zero

181
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:19,936
and y will still equal one,

182
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:22,375
and what that means is that cosine of x,

183
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,626
instead of being negative 0.42,

184
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:27,658
well what's cosine of zero,

185
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:31,586
that's actually precisely
equal to one, right?

186
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,445
We don't have to approximate on this one,

187
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:37,253
which means when we multiply
them, one times 0.54,

188
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:41,724
well that, that's gonna
now be about 0.54, right?

189
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:44,759
So this one, once we actually
perform the subtraction,

190
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,074
instead when you take one minus 0.54,

191
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:50,241
that's gonna give us 0.46.

192
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,777
So even before watching,
because this determinant

193
00:07:55,777 --> 00:08:00,462
of the Jacobian around the point
zero, one is less than one,

194
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:02,435
this is telling us we should expect areas

195
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:03,940
to get squished down.

196
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,401
Precisely, they should be
squished by a factor of 0.46.

197
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,759
And let's see if this looks right, right?

198
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,108
We're looking at the zoomed
in version around that point,

199
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:14,814
and areas should tend
to contract around that.

200
00:08:14,814 --> 00:08:16,126
And indeed, they do.

201
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:17,484
You see it got squished down,

202
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:18,940
it looks like by a fair bit,

203
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,881
and from our calculation,

204
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:22,289
we can conclude that they
got scaled down precisely

205
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,503
by a factor of 0.46.

206
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:27,032
That's what the determinant means.

207
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:29,022
So like I said, this is
actually a very nice notion

208
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,722
throughout multivariable calculus,

209
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:33,033
is that you look at a tiny
little local neighborhood

210
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,396
around a point,

211
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:35,932
and if you just want to
get a general feel for,

212
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,730
does this function, as a transformation,

213
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,830
tend to stretch out that region
or to squish it together,

214
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,972
how much do areas change in
that little neighborhood,

215
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:47,048
that's exactly what this
Jacobian determinant is,

216
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,131
you know, built to solve.

217
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:52,430
So with that, I'll see
you guys next video.
