1
00:00:00,361 --> 00:00:01,961
- [Voiceover] So one common
type of problem that you see

2
00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:04,062
in a number of multivariable
calculus classes

3
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:06,502
will say something to the
effect of the following:

4
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:09,462
find and classify all of
the critical point of,

5
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:12,822
and then you'll insert some
kind of multivariable function.

6
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:15,702
So first of all, this
idea of a critical point

7
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:18,782
basically means anywhere where
the gradient equals zero.

8
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:20,500
So you're looking for
places where the gradient

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,742
of your function, at some kind of input,

10
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:26,022
some specified input X and
Y that you're solving for,

11
00:00:26,022 --> 00:00:27,700
is equal to zero.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,302
And as I talked about in
the last couple of videos,

13
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:31,062
the reason you might want
to do this is because

14
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:32,502
you're hoping to maximize the function

15
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,262
or to maybe minimize the function.

16
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:37,660
And now the second requirement
of classifying those points,

17
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,902
that's what the second
derivative test is all about.

18
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:42,542
Once you find something, or
the gradient equals zero,

19
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,142
you want to be able to determine,

20
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:46,140
is it a local maximum,
is it a local minimum

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,062
or is it a settle point?

22
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:49,902
So let's go ahead and
work through this example.

23
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:51,780
The first thing we're gonna
need to do if we're solving

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,302
for when the gradient equals zero,

25
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:54,822
and remember, when we say equals zero,

26
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,702
we really mean the zero vector,

27
00:00:56,702 --> 00:00:58,662
but it's just a convenient
way of putting it all

28
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:01,340
on one line, we take
both partial derivatives.

29
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,902
So the partial derivative
with respect to X is,

30
00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:07,942
well, this first term,
when we take the derivative

31
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,582
of three X squared times
Y with respect to X,

32
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:14,665
the two hops down so we
have six times X times Y.

33
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:18,302
Y cubed, well, Y looks like a constant

34
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:21,622
so Y cubed looks like a
constant minus three X squared,

35
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:22,780
so that two comes down.

36
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,980
So we're subtracting off six times X.

37
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,580
Six times X.

38
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,340
And then again, this three Y squared term,

39
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,262
Y looks like a constant so everything here

40
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:33,382
looks like a constant
with zero derivative,

41
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:35,420
as far as the X direction is concerned.

42
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,837
And we do partial of f with respect to Y,

43
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:43,340
then this first term looks
like some sort of constant,

44
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,342
three X squared.

45
00:01:44,342 --> 00:01:46,582
X looks like a constant so
some kind of constant times Y.

46
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:50,340
So the whole thing looks
like three X squared.

47
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,020
The second term, minus X,
minus Y cubed, excuse me,

48
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,502
looks like minus three
Y squared when we take

49
00:01:56,502 --> 00:01:57,622
the derivative.

50
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:59,942
Minus three Y squared.

51
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:02,742
And then this next term only
has an X so it looks like

52
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:04,782
a constant as far as Y is concerned.

53
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:07,062
And then this last term,
we take down the two

54
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:08,742
because we're differentiating Y squared,

55
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:12,909
and you'll get negative six
Y, negative six times Y.

56
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:16,742
So when we are finding
the critical points,

57
00:02:16,742 --> 00:02:19,624
the first step is to set both
of these guys equal to zero.

58
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:22,144
So this first one, when we
do set it equal to zero,

59
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:25,184
we can typify a bit by
factoring out six X.

60
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:29,351
So this really looks like six
X multiplied by Y minus one.

61
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:36,824
And then that's what we're
setting equal to zero.

62
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,024
And what this equation
tells us is that either

63
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:41,544
it's the six X term that equals zero,

64
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:46,304
in which case that would
mean X is equal to zero;

65
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:49,944
or it's the case the Y
minus one equals zero,

66
00:02:49,944 --> 00:02:53,422
in which case that would
mean that Y equals one.

67
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:55,382
So at least one of these
things has to be true.

68
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:57,824
That's kind of the first
requirement that we found.

69
00:02:57,824 --> 00:02:59,462
Let me scroll down a little bit here.

70
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:02,384
And for the second equation,
when we set it equal to zero,

71
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:04,784
it's not immediately
straightforward how you would

72
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,904
solve for this in a nice
way in terms of X and Y,

73
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,944
but because we've already
solved one, we can kind of

74
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:13,144
plug them in and say, for
example, if it was the case

75
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:15,342
that X is equal to zero,

76
00:03:15,342 --> 00:03:17,384
and we kind of wanna see what
that turns our equation into,

77
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:19,224
then we would have, well, three X squared

78
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:22,264
is nothing that would be zero
and we'd just be left with

79
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:25,264
negative three Y squared minus six Y

80
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:28,904
is equal to zero.

81
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:31,784
And that, we can factor out a
bit, so I'm gonna factor out

82
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:33,367
a negative three Y.

83
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:37,184
So I'll factor out negative three Y,

84
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,304
which means that first
term just has a Y remaining

85
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,584
and then that second term
has a two, a positive two,

86
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:45,028
since I factored out negative three.

87
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:48,388
So positive two and that equals zero.

88
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:51,308
So what this whole situation
would imply is that either

89
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:54,188
negative three Y equals
zero, which would be,

90
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:56,508
which would mean Y equals zero;

91
00:03:56,508 --> 00:04:00,388
or it would be the case
the Y plus two equals zero,

92
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:03,866
which would mean that Y
is equal to negative two.

93
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:05,868
So that's the first
situation where we plug in

94
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:07,068
X equals zero.

95
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:09,308
Now alternatively, there's the possibility

96
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:13,746
that Y equals one, so we
could say Y equals one;

97
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:16,588
and what that gives us
in the entire equation,

98
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:18,306
we still have that three X squared

99
00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:21,348
because we're kind of solving
for X now, three X squared,

100
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,468
and then the rest of
it becomes, let's see,

101
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,028
minus three times one squared,

102
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:28,066
so minus three, we're
plugging in one for Y

103
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:31,706
then we subtract off six,
plugging in that one for Y again,

104
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:35,866
and that whole thing is
equal to three X squared

105
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:38,428
then minus three minus six.

106
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,761
So I'm subtracting off nine.

107
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,588
So from here, I can
factor out a little bit,

108
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:47,755
and this will be three multiplied
by X squared minus three.

109
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,308
And what that implies then,
since this whole thing

110
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:56,390
has to equal zero, what that
implies is that X squared

111
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,470
minus three is equal to zero
so we have X is equal to

112
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,720
plus or minus the square root of three.

113
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:06,310
And maybe I should kind of specify,

114
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,390
these are distinct things that we found.

115
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,670
One of them was in the
circumstance where X equals zero,

116
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,470
and then the other was where
we found in the circumstance

117
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,390
where Y equals one.

118
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,070
So this give us a grand
total of three different

119
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,830
critical points because
in the first situation,

120
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,070
where X equals zero, the
critical point that we have,

121
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,990
well, both of them are going to have

122
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,630
an X coordinate of zero in
them, X coordinate of zero;

123
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,632
and the two corresponding
Y coordinates are zero

124
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:31,672
or negative two.

125
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:34,422
So you have zero or negative two.

126
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,152
There's kind of two possibilities.

127
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:39,192
And then there's another
two possibilities here,

128
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:42,032
where if Y is equal to one,

129
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:43,870
when Y is equal to one,

130
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,552
we'll have X as positive or
negative square root of three.

131
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:49,072
So we have positive square
root of three and Y equals one,

132
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:52,752
and then we have negative
square root of three

133
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,910
and Y equals one.

134
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,472
So these, these are the critical points,

135
00:05:58,472 --> 00:05:59,805
critical points,

136
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,832
which basically means
all partial derivatives

137
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:05,352
are equal to zero.

138
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:07,710
In then in the next video, I
will classify each of these

139
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,960
critical points using the
second partial derivative test.
