00:00:00,339 --> 00:00:01,694
- [Instructor] In the
last video I introduced

2
00:00:01,694 --> 00:00:03,860
a constrained optimization problem

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,841
where we were trying to
maximize this function,

4
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:08,318
f of x, y equals x squared times y,

5
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:11,225
but subject to a constraint
that your values of x and y

6
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:15,251
have to satisfy x squared
plus y squared equals one.

7
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:17,053
And the way we were visualizing this

8
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:20,108
was to look at the x, y
plane where this circle here

9
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:21,530
represents our constraint.

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,195
All of the points that make up this set,

11
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:24,998
x squared plus y squared equals one,

12
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:29,689
and then this curvy line here
is one of the contours of f,

13
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:34,334
meaning, we're setting f of
x, y equal to some constant.

14
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,588
And then I was varying
around that constant c.

15
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:40,059
So for high values of c,
the contour would look

16
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,743
something like this,
this is where the value

17
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:44,011
of x squared times y is big.

18
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,412
And then for small values of c,

19
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:48,002
the contours would look like this.

20
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,460
So all the points on this
line would be f of x, y

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,434
equals like 0.01 in this
case, something like that.

22
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:57,185
Then the way to think about
maximizing this function

23
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,292
is to try to increase that value of c

24
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,965
as much as you can without
it falling off the circle.

25
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,663
And the key observation is

26
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:06,391
that happens when they're tangent.

27
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:08,079
So, you know, you might
kind of draw this out

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,797
in a little sketch and
say there's some curve

29
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,539
representing your constraint,
which in this case

30
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,727
would be, you know, where our circle is.

31
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:15,752
And then the curve
representing the contour

32
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:17,856
would just kiss that curve,

33
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:20,888
just barely touch it in some way.

34
00:01:20,888 --> 00:01:23,540
Now, that's pretty, but in
terms of solving the problem,

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,040
we still have some work to do.

36
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:29,543
And the main tool we're gonna
use here is the gradient.

37
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:31,702
So let me go ahead and draw
a lot more contour lines

38
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:34,222
than there already are
for x squared times y.

39
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:35,649
So this is many of the contour lines,

40
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,816
and I'll draw the gradient
field, the gradient field of f.

41
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,507
So I've made a video
about the relationship

42
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:45,774
between the gradient and contour lines.

43
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:48,566
And the upshot of it is
that these gradient vectors,

44
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,645
every time they pass
through a contour line,

45
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:52,799
they're perpendicular to it.

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,860
And the basic reason for that

47
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,826
is if you walk along the contour line,

48
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:57,488
the function isn't changing value,

49
00:01:57,488 --> 00:01:59,392
so if you want it to change most rapidly,

50
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:01,044
you know, it kind of makes
sense you should walk

51
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:02,936
in the perpendicular direction,

52
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:05,270
so that no component of
the walk that you're taking

53
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,770
is, you know, useless, is along the line

54
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,972
where the function doesn't change.

55
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,431
But again, there's a whole video on that

56
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:15,579
that's worthy checking out
if this feels unfamiliar.

57
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,268
For our purposes, what it means is that

58
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:19,691
when we're considering
this point of tangency,

59
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:24,434
the gradient of f at that
point is gonna be some vector

60
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:27,398
perpendicular to both
the curves at that point.

61
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:30,298
So that little vector
represents the gradient of f

62
00:02:30,298 --> 00:02:33,329
at this point on the plane.

63
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,512
And we can do something very similar

64
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:36,361
to understand the other curve.

65
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,939
Right now I've just
written it as a constraint,

66
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,758
x squared plus y squared equals one.

67
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:41,625
But you know, to give
that function a name,

68
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,875
let's say we've defined g of x, y to be

69
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:48,859
x squared plus y squared,

70
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:50,463
x squared plus y squared.

71
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:52,979
In that case, this
constraint is pretty much

72
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,198
just one of the contour
lines for the function g,

73
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:57,289
and we can take a look at that.

74
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:58,867
If we go over here and we look at

75
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:02,165
all of the other contour
lines for this function g,

76
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:03,614
and it should make sense
that they're circles,

77
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:08,009
because this function is
x squared plus y squared.

78
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:10,263
And if we took a look
at the gradient of g,

79
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:14,180
and we go over and ask
about the gradient of g,

80
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:16,847
it has that same property,

81
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:18,097
that every gradient vector,

82
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,797
if it passes through a contour line,

83
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:21,688
is perpendicular to it.

84
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:23,197
So over on our drawing here,

85
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:26,257
the gradient vector of g
would also be perpendicular

86
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:27,663
to both these curves.

87
00:03:27,663 --> 00:03:28,648
And you know, maybe in this case,

88
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:31,574
it's not as long as the gradient
of f, or maybe it's longer.

89
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:33,563
There's no reason that it
would be the same length,

90
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:37,574
but the important fact is
that it's proportional.

91
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:39,338
And the way that we're
gonna write this in formulas

92
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:42,695
is to say that the
gradient of f evaluated,

93
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:45,741
let's see, evaluated at
whatever the maximizing value

94
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:48,231
of x and y are, so we should
give that a name probably.

95
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:52,139
Maybe x sub m, y sub
m, the specific values

96
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,433
of x and y that are gonna be at this point

97
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:57,615
that maximizes the function
subject to our constraint.

98
00:03:57,615 --> 00:04:00,443
So that's gonna be related
to the gradient of g,

99
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:01,377
it's not gonna be quite equal,

100
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:03,006
so I'll leave some room here.

101
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:05,041
Related to the gradient of g,

102
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,124
evaluated at that same point, xm, ym.

103
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:13,719
And like I said, they're not
equal, they're proportional.

104
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,715
So we need to have some kind

105
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:16,633
of proportionality constant in there.

106
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,475
You almost always use the variable lambda,

107
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:20,775
and this guy has a fancy name,

108
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:24,343
it's called a Lagrange multiplier.

109
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:26,284
Lagrange, Lagrange was one

110
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:29,418
of those famous French mathematicians.

111
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:30,976
I always get him confused
with some of the other

112
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:34,814
French mathematicians at the
time like Legendre or Laplace,

113
00:04:34,814 --> 00:04:36,161
there's a whole bunch of things.

114
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:40,513
Let's see, multiplier,
distracting myself talking here.

115
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,129
So Lagrange multiplier.

116
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:44,589
So there's a number of things
in multivariable calculus

117
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:47,031
named after Lagrange, and
this is one of the big ones.

118
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:50,210
This is a technique that
he kind of developed

119
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,262
or at the very least popularized.

120
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:53,917
And the core idea is to just set

121
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,721
these gradients equal to each other,

122
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,860
'cause that represents
when the contour line

123
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,834
for one function is tangent to
the contour line of another.

124
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:05,972
So this, this is something
that we can actually work with.

125
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,968
And let's start working it out, right,

126
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:10,280
let's see what this
translates to in formulas.

127
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,332
So I already have g written here,

128
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:12,776
so let's go ahead and just evaluate

129
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:15,526
what the gradient of g should be.

130
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:21,184
And that's the gradient of
x squared plus y squared.

131
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,161
And the way that we take our gradient is

132
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:24,913
it's gonna be a vector

133
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:26,850
whose components are
all partial derivatives.

134
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,361
So the first component
is the partial derivative

135
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,840
with respect to x.

136
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,701
So we treat x as a variable,
y looks like a constant.

137
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,325
The derivative is two x.

138
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:36,108
The second component
the partial derivative

139
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,990
with respect to y, so now we're
treating y as the variable,

140
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,157
x is the constant, so the
derivative looks like two y.

141
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:46,674
So that's the gradient of g.

142
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:50,590
Then the gradient of f, gradient of f.

143
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,427
It's gonna look like gradient of,

144
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:54,438
let's see, what is x?

145
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,271
What is f?

146
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,142
It's x squared times y.

147
00:05:57,142 --> 00:05:59,142
So x squared times y.

148
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,131
We do the same thing.

149
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:04,604
First component partial
derivative with respect to x,

150
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:07,751
x looks like a variable, so
it's derivative is two times x

151
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:10,932
and then that y looks like a
constant when we're up here.

152
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:13,647
But then partial derivative
with respect to y,

153
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,928
that y looks like a variable,
that x squared just looks

154
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:18,873
like a constant sitting in front of it.

155
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:20,277
So that's what we get.

156
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:22,307
And now if we kind of work out

157
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,646
this Lagrange mulitplier expression

158
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:29,016
using these two vectors,
what we have written,

159
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:32,364
what we're gonna have
written is that this vector,

160
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:33,947
two xy x squared

161
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:41,050
is proportional with the
proportionality constant lambda to

162
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:45,199
the gradient vector for g.

163
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,699
So two x two y.

164
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:49,772
And if you want you can think about this

165
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:51,311
as two separate equations.

166
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,204
I mean right now it's one
equation with vectors,

167
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,791
but really what this is saying is

168
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,572
you've got two separate equations,

169
00:06:57,572 --> 00:07:01,001
two times xy is equal to lambda,

170
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:03,049
ah, gotta change colors a lot here.

171
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:05,397
Lambda times two x.

172
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:08,110
Hm, gonna be stickler for color.

173
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,787
Keep red all of the
things associated with g.

174
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:12,620
And then,

175
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:15,728
this second equation is that x squared

176
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,311
is equal to lambda times two y.

177
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,906
And this might seem like a problem,

178
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:25,177
because we have three unknowns, x, y,

179
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,911
and this new lambda that we introduced.

180
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:27,966
Kind of shot ourselves in the foot

181
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:30,325
by giving ourselves a new
variable to deal with.

182
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,124
But we only have two equations.

183
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:35,426
So in order to solve this, we're
gonna need three equations.

184
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:36,909
And the third equation is something

185
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,175
that we've known the whole time.

186
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,104
It's been part of the original problem.

187
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:41,507
It's the constraint itself,

188
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:44,507
x squared plus y squared equals one.

189
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:48,012
So that, that third equation,

190
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:51,921
x squared plus y squared is equal to one.

191
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,857
So these are the three equations

192
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:57,604
that characterize our
constrained optimization problem.

193
00:07:57,604 --> 00:07:59,079
The bottom one just tells you

194
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,023
that we have to be on
this unit circle here.

195
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,558
Allow me to just highlight it.

196
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,477
We have to be on this unit circle.

197
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:08,313
And then these top two
tell us what's necessary

198
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:10,025
in order for our contour lines,

199
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:12,077
the contour of f and the contour of g

200
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:15,133
to be perfectly tangent with each other.

201
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:18,391
So, in the next video, I'll
go ahead and solve this.

202
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:20,800
At this point, it's pretty
much just algebra to deal with,

203
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,367
but it's worthy going through.

204
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,783
And then in the next couple ones,

205
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,444
I'll talk about a way
that you can encapsulate

206
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:28,311
all three of these equations
into one expression,

207
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,357
and also a little bit
about the interpretation

208
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:31,901
of this lambda that we introduced.

209
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:33,480
'Cause it's not actually
just a dummy variable,

210
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,966
it has a pretty interesting
meaning in physical contexts

211
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,368
once you're actually dealing

212
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:41,260
with a constrained optimization
problem in practice.

213
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,097
So I'll see you in the next video.
