1
00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:02,277
- [Voiceover] So let's say you
have yourselves some kind of

2
00:00:02,277 --> 00:00:03,299
multivariable function,

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:05,983
and this time its got some
very high dimensional inputs.

4
00:00:05,983 --> 00:00:09,983
So x1, x2 on and on and
on up to sub x sub n,

5
00:00:11,154 --> 00:00:12,781
for some large number n.

6
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:14,979
In the last couple videos I told you about

7
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:16,565
the Laplacian operator,

8
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:19,695
which is a way of taking in
your scalar valued function f

9
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,563
and it gives you a new
scalar valued function

10
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,474
that's kind of like a
second derivative thing

11
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:26,647
because it takes the
divergence of the gradient

12
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:27,991
of your function f.

13
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:30,190
So the gradient of f
gives you a vector field

14
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,199
and the divergence of that
gives you a scalar field.

15
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,229
And what I want to show
you here is another formula

16
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:37,954
that you might commonly
see for this Laplacian.

17
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,023
So first let's kind of
abstractly write out

18
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:42,259
what the gradient of f will look like.

19
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,577
So we start by taking this del operator,

20
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,308
which is going to be a vector
full of partial differential

21
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:48,141
operators.

22
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:49,867
Partial with respect to x1,

23
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:52,117
partial with respect to x2,

24
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:55,553
and kind of on and on and on up to

25
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:59,900
partial with respect to
that last input variable.

26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,031
And then you kind of just
imagine multiplying it

27
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,533
by your function,

28
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,239
so what you end up getting

29
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,882
is all the different
partial derivatives of f.

30
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:12,665
It's partial of f with
respect to the first variable,

31
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:14,453
and then kind of on and on and on

32
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:18,354
up until you get the
partial derivative of f

33
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:20,634
with respect to that last variable,

34
00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:21,467
x sub n.

35
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:26,077
And the divergence of that

36
00:01:26,077 --> 00:01:29,125
and just to save myself
some writing I'm gonna say

37
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,198
you take that nabla operator,

38
00:01:31,198 --> 00:01:33,641
and then you imagine
taking the dot product

39
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:35,310
between that whole operator

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,033
and this gradient vector
that you have here,

41
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,817
what you end up getting is

42
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:42,545
well, you start by multiplying
the first components

43
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:44,532
which involves taking
the partial derivative

44
00:01:44,532 --> 00:01:45,872
with respect to x1,

45
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,839
that first variable of the
partial derivative of f

46
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:50,708
with respect to that same variable.

47
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,730
So it looks like the second
partial derivative of f

48
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,730
with respect to that first variable.

49
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:01,592
So the second partial derivative
of f with respect to x1,

50
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:03,097
that first variable.

51
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:05,215
Then you imagine kind of adding

52
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:08,342
what the product of these
next two items will be

53
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:10,497
and for very similar reasons
that's gonna look like the

54
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,952
second partial derivative
of f with respect

55
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:15,580
to that second variable,

56
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,163
partial x2 squared.

57
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,522
And you do this to all of them

58
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,963
and you're adding them all
up until you find yourself

59
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:23,505
doing it to the last one.

60
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,545
So you've got plus and
a whole bunch things

61
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:29,367
and you'll be taking the
second partial derivative of f

62
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,766
with respect to that last variable,

63
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:33,599
partial of x sub n.

64
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:37,491
This is another format in which
you might see the Laplacian,

65
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,295
and often times it's
written kind of compactly,

66
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:43,426
so people will say the
Laplacian of your function f,

67
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:45,946
is equal to, using sigma notation,

68
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:49,696
you'd say the sum from
i is equal to 1 up to,

69
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:53,464
you know, 1, 2, 3 up to n.

70
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,495
So the sum from that up to n,

71
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:57,608
of your second partial derivatives.

72
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:01,358
Partial squared of f
with that i-th variable.

73
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:06,437
So if you were thinking in
terms of three variables

74
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:09,448
often x1, x2, x3 we instead write x, y, z,

75
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:12,578
but is common to more
generally just say x sub i.

76
00:03:12,578 --> 00:03:15,706
So this here is kind of
the alternate formula

77
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,780
that you might see for the Laplacian.

78
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,565
Personally I always like to think about it

79
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:23,224
as taking the divergence
of the gradient of f,

80
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:25,134
because you're thinking
about the gradient field,

81
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:27,369
and the divergence of
that kind of corresponds

82
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:30,250
to maxima and minima of
your original function,

83
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,554
which is what I talked about

84
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:33,872
in the initial intuition
of Laplacian video.

85
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:36,535
But this formula is probably
a little more straightforward

86
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:39,049
when it comes to actual computations and,

87
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,398
oh wait sorry I forgot a
square there, didn't I?

88
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:46,696
Partial x squared, so this
is the second derivative.

89
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:50,074
So summing all these
second partial derivatives.

90
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,704
And you can probably see this a kind of

91
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:53,863
a more straightforward way
to compute a given example

92
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:55,490
that you might come across,

93
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,685
and it also makes it
clearer how the Laplacian

94
00:03:57,685 --> 00:04:01,590
is kind of an extension of the
idea of a second derivative.

95
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,574
See you next video.
