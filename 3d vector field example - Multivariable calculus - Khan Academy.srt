1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,828
- [Voiceover] So in the last video,

2
00:00:00,828 --> 00:00:03,348
I talked about
3-dimensional vector fields.

3
00:00:03,348 --> 00:00:04,149
And I finished things off

4
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:06,250
with a sort of identity function example

5
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,803
where at an input point x, y, z

6
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,485
the output vector is also x, y, z.

7
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:13,924
And here, I want to go through

8
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:16,596
a slightly more intricate example.

9
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:19,776
So I'll go ahead and get
rid of this vector field

10
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:21,540
and in this example,

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,521
the x component of the
output will be y times z.

12
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:30,225
The y component of the
output will be x times z.

13
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:34,625
And the z component of the
output will be x times y.

14
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,227
So I'll just show this vector field

15
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:38,914
and then we can start to get a feel for

16
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,743
how the function that I just wrote

17
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:42,868
relates to the vectors that you're seeing.

18
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:43,843
So you see some of the vectors

19
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,701
are kind of pointing away from the origin.

20
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:48,209
Some are pointing in towards the origin.

21
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:52,353
So how can we understand this vector field

22
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,478
in terms of the function itself?

23
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:55,976
And a good step is to just zero in

24
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:57,473
on one of the components.

25
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:59,377
So in this case, I'll
choose the z component

26
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:00,968
of the output

27
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:03,035
which is made up of x times y

28
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:03,975
and kind of start to understand

29
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:04,869
what that should be.

30
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:06,552
The z component will represent

31
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:08,851
how much the vector's pointing up or down.

32
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,256
This is the z axis

33
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:11,835
and the x-y plane here

34
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:13,890
so I'll point the z axis
straight at our face.

35
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,374
This is the x axis, this is the y axis.

36
00:01:16,374 --> 00:01:18,859
The values of x and y are
going to completely determine

37
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,136
that z component.

38
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:21,378
So I'm going to go off to the side here

39
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:25,976
and just draw myself a little
x-y plane for reference.

40
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:28,878
So this is my x value,

41
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:30,353
this is my y value.

42
00:01:30,353 --> 00:01:31,688
And I want to understand the meaning

43
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:35,008
of the term "x times y."

44
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,412
So when both x and y are positive,

45
00:01:37,412 --> 00:01:39,617
the product is positive.

46
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:40,976
And when both of them are negative,

47
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,449
the product is also positive.

48
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:45,469
If x is negative and y is positive,

49
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:46,874
the product is negative,

50
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,778
but if x is positive and y is negative,

51
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:50,670
the product is also negative.

52
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,436
So what this should mean,

53
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:52,772
in terms of our vector field,

54
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:54,292
is that when we're in this first quadrant,

55
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:56,858
vectors tend to point
up in the z direction,

56
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:59,419
same over here in the third quadrant.

57
00:01:59,419 --> 00:01:59,970
But over in the other two

58
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,479
they should tend to point down.

59
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,895
So let's focus in on that first quadrant

60
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:04,614
and try to look at what's going on.

61
00:02:04,614 --> 00:02:07,075
So, you see like this vector
here applies, this vector.

62
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:09,269
And all of them generally point upwards,

63
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:11,139
they have a positive z component.

64
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:13,054
So that seems in line with
what we were predicting.

65
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:13,960
Whereas over here,

66
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,574
which corresponds to the fourth quadrant

67
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:16,653
of the x-y plane,

68
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:19,835
the z component of each
vector tends to be down.

69
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:22,040
And they're doing other things

70
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,515
in terms of the x and y components,

71
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:24,920
it's not just z component action,

72
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,940
but right now we're just
focusing on up and down.

73
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,668
And if you look over
in the third quadrant,

74
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:31,154
they tend to be pointing up,

75
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:32,948
and that corresponds to the fact

76
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:34,510
that x times y will be positive.

77
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,102
And when you look at it,

78
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:36,785
it all starts to align that way.

79
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:38,329
And because I chose a
rather symmetric function

80
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,047
you could imagine doing this where you,

81
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:43,182
you analyze also the y component here,

82
00:02:43,182 --> 00:02:46,224
you analyze the x component
in terms of y and z,

83
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,582
and it's actually going
to look very similar

84
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:50,090
for understanding when the
x component of a vector

85
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,228
tends to be positive,

86
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:51,924
like up here,

87
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:53,085
or when it turns out to be negative,

88
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,339
like over here,

89
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:55,663
and same with when the y
component of the vector

90
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:56,789
tends to be negative,

91
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:58,949
or if the y component
tends to be positive.

92
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,420
And overall, it's a very
complicated image to look at,

93
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,566
but you can slowly piece
by piece get a feel for it.

94
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,203
And just like with
2-dimensional vector fields,

95
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:08,387
the kind of neat thing to do

96
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:11,046
is imagine that this
represents a fluid flow.

97
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:12,822
So you imagine like maybe air around you,

98
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:14,935
flowing in towards the origin here,

99
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:17,048
flowing out away from the origin there,

100
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:19,173
it would kind of be rotating around here,

101
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:21,387
and later on in multi-variable calculus,

102
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,399
you'll learn about
various ways you can study

103
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:25,698
just the function itself
and just the variables

104
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:28,519
and get a feel for how that
fluid itself would behave,

105
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,725
even though it's a very
complicated thing to think about,

106
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:31,967
it's even complicated to draw

107
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:33,581
or use graphic software with,

108
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,299
but just with analytic tools,

109
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,762
you can get very powerful results.

110
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,930
And these kind of things come
up in physics all the time

111
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,567
because you're thinking
in 3-dimensional space

112
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,587
and it doesn't just have to be fluid flow,

113
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:47,188
it could be a force field
like an electric force field

114
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:48,836
or gravitational force field,

115
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:49,765
where each vector tells you

116
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:52,145
how a particle tends to get pushed.

117
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,328
And as we continue on with
multi-variable calculus,

118
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:56,337
you'll get to see lots more examples.

119
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,695
But hopefully this helps give a small feel

120
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,053
for how you can go piece by piece

121
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:00,470
and understand something

122
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,149
that's kind of a complicated expression.
