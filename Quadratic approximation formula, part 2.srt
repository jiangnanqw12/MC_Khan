00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:03,789
- [Voiceover] ♫ Line things
up a little bit right here. ♫

2
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:04,622
All right.

3
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:07,953
So in the last video I
set up the scaffolding

4
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:09,825
for the quadratic approximation which

5
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:12,263
I'm calling Q of a function,

6
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:15,119
an arbitrary two variable
function which I'm calling f,

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,252
and the form that we have right now

8
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:18,496
looks like quite a lot actually.

9
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:20,029
We have six different terms.

10
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:22,283
Now the first three were
just basically stolen

11
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:24,606
from the local linearization formula

12
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:26,212
and written in their full abstractness.

13
00:00:26,212 --> 00:00:27,791
It almost makes it seem a little bit more

14
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,393
complicated than it is.

15
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:31,065
And then these next three terms

16
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:32,946
are basically the quadratic parts.

17
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:35,512
We have what is basically X squared.

18
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:37,859
We take it as X minus X naught squared

19
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:39,757
so that we don't mess
with anything previously

20
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:42,357
once we plug in X equals X naught,

21
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:44,446
but basically we think
of this as X squared.

22
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:46,537
And then this here is basically X times Y,

23
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:48,650
but of course we're
matching each one of them

24
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,181
with the corresponding X naught Y naught,

25
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,969
and then this term is the Y squared.

26
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,625
And the question at hand is

27
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,888
how do we fill in these constants?

28
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:57,955
The coefficients in front of each one

29
00:00:57,955 --> 00:00:59,873
of these quadratic terms to make it

30
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:02,821
so that this guy Q hugs the graph of f

31
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,191
as closely as possible.

32
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,546
And I showed that in the very first video,

33
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:07,828
kind of what that hugging means.

34
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:09,755
Now in formulas, the goal here,

35
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:10,847
I should probably state,

36
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:13,307
what it is that we want is for the second

37
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,700
partial derivatives of Q,

38
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,696
so for example if we take
the partial derivative

39
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:19,855
with respect to X twice in a row,

40
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:22,195
we want it to be the case
that if you take that guy

41
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:24,935
and you evaluate it at
the point of interest,

42
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:27,164
the point about which
we are approximating,

43
00:01:27,164 --> 00:01:28,953
it should be the same as when you take

44
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:30,672
the second partial derivative of f

45
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:32,598
or the corresponding
second partial derivative

46
00:01:32,598 --> 00:01:34,701
I should say since
there's multiple different

47
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,164
second partial derivatives,

48
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:39,136
and you evaluate it at that same point.

49
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:40,634
And of course we want this to be true

50
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,991
not just with the second
partial derivative

51
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:44,640
with respect to X twice in a row,

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,870
but if we did it with the other ones.

53
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,939
Like for example,

54
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,982
let's say we took the partial derivative

55
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:50,631
first with respect to X,

56
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:52,093
and then with respect to Y.

57
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:54,044
This is called the mixed
partial derivative.

58
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:56,146
We want it to be the case
that when we evaluate that

59
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:59,206
at the point of interest
it's the same as taking

60
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:04,073
the mixed partial derivative
of f with respect to X,

61
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,791
and then with respect to Y,

62
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,958
and we evaluate it at that same point.

63
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,137
And remember, for almost all
functions that you deal with,

64
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:16,975
when you take this
second partial derivative

65
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:20,048
where we mix two of the variables,

66
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:21,765
it doesn't matter the order in which

67
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:22,598
you take them, right?

68
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:24,774
You could take it first
with respect to X then Y

69
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:26,980
or you could it first with respect to Y,

70
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,514
and then with respect to X.

71
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:29,929
Usually these guys are equal.

72
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:32,042
There are some functions
for which this isn't true,

73
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,286
but we're going to basically assume that

74
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,120
we're dealing with
functions where this is.

75
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,536
So, that's the only
mixed partial derivative

76
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:39,207
that we have to take into account.

77
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:42,353
And I'll just kind of get
rid of that guy there.

78
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:44,720
And then, of course, the final one,

79
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,265
just to have it on record here,

80
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,541
is that we want the partial derivative

81
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,792
when we take it with respect to Y

82
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:51,908
two times in a row

83
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:54,252
and we evaluate that at the same point,

84
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:55,720
there's kind of a lot,

85
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,904
there's a lot of writing that goes on

86
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:59,480
with these things and that's just kind of

87
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,469
par for the course when it comes

88
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:01,839
to multi-variable calculus,

89
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,984
but you take the partial derivative

90
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,998
with respect to Y, add both of them,

91
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:09,086
and you want it to be the
same value at this point.

92
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,387
So even though there's
a lot going on here,

93
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:12,476
all I'm basically saying is all the second

94
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:14,690
to partial differential
information should be the same

95
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,199
for Q as it is for f.

96
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,126
So, let's actually go up and take a look

97
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:21,542
at our function and start thinking about

98
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,832
what it's partial derivatives are.

99
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:26,315
What it's first and second
partial derivatives are.

100
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:27,148
And to do that,

101
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:29,264
let me first just kind of clear up

102
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:31,097
some of the board here

103
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,932
just to make it so we can actually start

104
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:37,670
computing what this second
partial derivative is.

105
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,809
So let's go ahead and do it.

106
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:41,830
First, this partial derivative
with respect to X twice,

107
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,856
what we'll do is I'll
take one of those out

108
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,085
and think partial derivative
with respect to X.

109
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:47,409
And then on the inside I'm going to put

110
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:50,439
what the partial derivative
of this entire expression

111
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,424
with respect to X is.

112
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,315
But we just take it one term at a time.

113
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:56,232
This first term here is a constant,

114
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:58,065
so that goes to zero.

115
00:03:58,065 --> 00:04:01,757
The second term here actually
has the variable X in it.

116
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:03,429
And when we take it's partial derivative,

117
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:05,247
since this is a linear term,

118
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:07,540
it's just going to be that
constant sitting in front of it.

119
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,862
So it will be that
constant which is the value

120
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:13,249
of the partial derivative
of f with respect to X

121
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:16,166
evaluated at the point of interest.

122
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,632
And that's just a constant.

123
00:04:18,632 --> 00:04:20,093
All right, so that's there.

124
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,616
This next term has no Xs in it,

125
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:23,311
so that's just going to go to zero.

126
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:27,254
This term is interesting
because it's got an X in it.

127
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:29,530
So when we take its
derivative with respect to X,

128
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,900
that two comes down.

129
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,988
So this will be two times a,

130
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:34,748
whatever the constant a is,

131
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:37,331
multiplied by X minus X naught.

132
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:40,925
That's what the derivative
of this component is

133
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:42,434
with respect to X.

134
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:43,758
Then this over here,

135
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,315
this also has an X,

136
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:47,372
but it's just showing up
basically as a linear term.

137
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:48,858
And when we treat Y as a constant,

138
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:50,414
since we're taking the partial derivative

139
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:51,923
with respect to X,

140
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:55,939
what that ends up being
is b multiplied by that,

141
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:58,632
what looks like a constant
as far as X is concerned,

142
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,543
Y minus Y naught.

143
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,866
And then the last term
doesn't have any Xs in it.

144
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:05,791
So that is the first partial derivative

145
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,327
with respect to X.

146
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:08,186
And now we do it again.

147
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,834
Now we take the partial
derivative with respect to X,

148
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,273
and I'll hmm,

149
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:14,085
maybe I should actually clear up

150
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:15,802
even more of this guy.

151
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:17,195
And now when we take
the partial derivative

152
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:19,959
of this expression with respect to X,

153
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,561
f of X of X naught, Y naught,

154
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:22,653
that's just a constant,

155
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:24,324
so that goes to zero.

156
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,727
Two times a times X, that's going to,

157
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,190
we take the derivative with respect to X

158
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,652
and we're just going to get two times a.

159
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:33,254
And this last term
doesn't have an Xs in it,

160
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:34,834
so that also goes to zero.

161
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,994
So conveniently,

162
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:38,502
when we take the second partial derivative

163
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:40,198
of Q with respect to X,

164
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:41,520
We just get a constant.

165
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,190
It's this constant to a.

166
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,025
And since we want it to be the case,

167
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:49,608
we want that this entire
thing is equal to,

168
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:52,666
well what do we want?

169
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,570
We want it to be the
second partial derivative

170
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,055
of f both times with respect to X.

171
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,029
So here I'm going to use
the subscript notation.

172
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,909
Over here I'm using the
kind of Leibniz notation,

173
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,375
but here just second partial derivative

174
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,815
with respect to X,

175
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:06,067
we want it to match
whatever that looks like

176
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:09,295
when we evaluate it at
the point of interest.

177
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:10,782
So what we could do to make that happen,

178
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:13,170
to make sure that two
a is equal to this guy,

179
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,253
is we set a equal to one half of that

180
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,621
second partial derivative evaluated

181
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,704
at the point of interest.

182
00:06:24,943 --> 00:06:26,651
Okay. So this is something
we kind of tuck away.

183
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,318
We remember this is,

184
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,991
we have solved for one of the constants.

185
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,872
So now let's start thinking
about another one of them.

186
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:35,219
Well I guess actually I
don't have to scroll off

187
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:37,099
because let's say we just want to take

188
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:39,677
the mixed partial derivative here where

189
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:41,999
if instead of taking it
with respect to X twice,

190
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,623
we wanted to, let's see
I'll kind of erase this,

191
00:06:44,623 --> 00:06:47,665
we wanted to first do
it with respect to X,

192
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:49,754
and then do it with respect to Y.

193
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:50,789
Then we can kind of just edit what

194
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:52,136
we have over here and we say,

195
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:53,991
"we already took it with respect to X,

196
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,824
"so now as our second go we're going to be

197
00:06:56,824 --> 00:06:59,028
"taking it with respect to Y."

198
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:00,189
So in that case,

199
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:03,068
instead of getting two a
let's kind of figure out

200
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:04,508
what it is that we get.

201
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,250
When we take the derivative
of this whole guy

202
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,875
with respect to Y,

203
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,034
well this looks like a constant.

204
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:11,753
This here also looks like a constant

205
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:13,169
since we're doing it with respect to Y

206
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,539
and no Ys show up.

207
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:16,025
And the partial derivative of this

208
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,604
just ends up being b.

209
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,485
So again, we just get a constant.

210
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,178
This time it's b not two,

211
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:23,363
previously it was two a,

212
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:24,826
but now it's just b.

213
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:26,451
And this time we want it to equal

214
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,076
the mixed partial derivative.

215
00:07:28,076 --> 00:07:30,445
So instead of saying f sub XX,

216
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:32,813
I'm going to f XY which basically says

217
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:34,452
you take the partial derivative first

218
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:36,799
with respect to X and
then with respect to Y.

219
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:39,817
We want this guy to
equal the value of that

220
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:42,464
mixed partial derivative
evaluated at that point.

221
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:43,300
So that gives us another fact.

222
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,208
That means we can just
basically set b equal to that.

223
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,914
And this is another fact,

224
00:07:48,914 --> 00:07:51,120
another constant that we can record.

225
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,287
And now for C,

226
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:55,192
when we're trying to figure
out what that should be,

227
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:56,956
the reasoning is almost identical.

228
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:58,025
It's pretty much symmetric.

229
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:00,742
We did everything that
we did for the case X,

230
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:03,331
and instead we do it for
taking the partial derivative

231
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:05,406
with respect to Y twice in a row,

232
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:06,939
and I encourage you to
do that for yourself.

233
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,944
It'll definitely solidify everything that

234
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:10,801
we're doing here because it can seem

235
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:12,868
kind of like a lot and
a lot of computations.

236
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,623
But you're going to get
basically the same conclusion

237
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:16,241
you did for the constant a.

238
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:18,726
It's going to be the case
that you have the constant c

239
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:22,836
is equal to one half of the
second partial derivative

240
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,577
of f with respect to Y,

241
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:26,899
so you're differentiating
with respect to Y twice

242
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,243
evaluated at the point of interest.

243
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,494
So this is going to be
kind of the third fact.

244
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:35,537
And the way that you get
to that conclusion again,

245
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,418
it's going to be almost
identical to the way

246
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:39,252
that we found this one for X.

247
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,760
Now when you plug in these
values for a, b and c,

248
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,898
and these are constants,

249
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,686
even though we've written them as formulas

250
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:45,963
they are constants,

251
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:48,958
when you plus those in
to this full formula,

252
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,118
you're going to get the
quadratic approximation.

253
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:52,697
It'll have six separate terms.

254
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:54,554
One that corresponds to the constant,

255
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:56,807
two that correspond to the linear fact,

256
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,150
and then three which correspond to

257
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,868
the various quadratic terms.

258
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:01,447
And if you wanted to dig into more details

259
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:03,844
and kind of go through an
example or two on this,

260
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,584
I do have an article on
quadratic approximations

261
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:08,139
and hopefully you can kind of step through

262
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:11,009
and do some of the computations
yourself as you go.

263
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,357
But in all of this,

264
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:14,145
even though there's a
lot of formulas going on,

265
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:15,863
it can be pretty notationly heavy.

266
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:16,990
I want you to think back to that

267
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,140
original graphical intuition, here,

268
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,135
let me actually pull up the
graphical intuition here.

269
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:23,551
So if you're approximating a function

270
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,130
near a specific point,

271
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,221
the quadratic approximation looks like

272
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:29,521
this curve where if you were to chop it

273
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:32,445
in any direction it would be a parabola,

274
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:34,419
but it's hugging the graph pretty closely.

275
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,440
So it gives up a pretty
close approximation.

276
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,948
So even though there's a lot of formulas

277
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:39,273
that go on to get us that,

278
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:41,515
the ultimate visual and I
think the ultimate intuition

279
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,277
is actually a pretty sensible one.

280
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:44,439
You're just hoping to find something that

281
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:46,808
hugs the function nice and closely.

282
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:49,272
And with that, I will see you next video.
