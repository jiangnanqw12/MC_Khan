1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:01,853
- [Voiceover] So far,
when I've talked about

2
00:00:01,853 --> 00:00:03,457
the gradient of a function,

3
00:00:03,457 --> 00:00:05,199
and let's think about this as a

4
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:07,275
multi-variable function
with just two inputs.

5
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:09,272
Those are the easiest to think about.

6
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:12,569
So maybe it's something like
x squared plus y squared,

7
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:14,652
a very friendly function.

8
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:17,070
When I've talked about the gradient,

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,951
I've left open a mystery.

10
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:20,693
We have the way of computing it,

11
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:22,771
and the way that you
think about computing it

12
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:23,828
is you just take this vector,

13
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:26,300
and you just throw the
partial derivatives in there.

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,530
Partial with respect to x,

15
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,363
and the partial with respect to y,

16
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:35,039
and if it was a higher dimensional input,

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,999
then the output would have as
many variables as you need.

18
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:39,590
If it was f of x,y,z,

19
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,678
you'd have partial x,
partial y, partial z.

20
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:44,153
And this is the way to compute it.

21
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:46,184
But then I gave you a graphical intuition.

22
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:48,994
I said that it points in the
direction of steepest ascent,

23
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:50,321
and maybe the way you think about that

24
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:52,690
is you have your input space,

25
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,368
which in this case is the x,y plane,

26
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:58,630
and you think of it as
somehow mapping over

27
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,128
to the number line,

28
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,556
to your output space,

29
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:03,901
and if you have a given point somewhere,

30
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:04,795
the question is,

31
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:06,142
of all the possible directions

32
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:08,290
that you can move away from this point,

33
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,368
all those different
directions you could go,

34
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:12,470
which one of them--

35
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,898
this point will land somewhere

36
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:14,885
on the function,

37
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:16,383
and as you move in the various directions

38
00:01:16,383 --> 00:01:18,669
maybe one of them nudges
your output a little bit,

39
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:20,063
one of them nudges it a lot,

40
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,670
one of it slides it negative,

41
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,395
one of them slides it negative a lot.

42
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:25,079
Which one of these directions

43
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,539
results in the greatest
increase to your function?

44
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:29,665
And this was the loose intuition.

45
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:31,383
If you want to think in terms of graphs,

46
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,030
we could look over at the
graph of f of x squared,

47
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,609
and this is the gradient field.

48
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,815
All of these vectors in the x,y plane

49
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:38,872
are the gradients.

50
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:40,369
As you kind of look from below,

51
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:41,670
you can maybe see why

52
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,154
each one of these points in
the direction you should move

53
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,337
to walk uphill on that graph

54
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:47,800
as fast as you can.

55
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,821
If you're a mountain climber,

56
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:51,016
and you want to get to the
top as quickly as possible,

57
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:53,338
these tell you the direction
that you should move

58
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:54,232
to go as quickly.

59
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:57,517
This is why you call it
direction of steepest ascent.

60
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,017
So back over here,

61
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:01,659
I don't see the connection immediately,

62
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,324
or at least when I was
first learning about it,

63
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:04,417
it wasn't clear

64
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:08,121
why this combination
of partial derivatives

65
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:11,163
has anything to do with
choosing the best direction.

66
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,845
And now that we've learned about
the directional derivative,

67
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:16,104
I can give you a little
bit of an intuition.

68
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:17,989
So let's say instead of thinking about

69
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:19,951
all the possible directions,

70
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:21,875
and all of the possible changes

71
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,027
to the output that they have,

72
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:26,527
so I'll fill in my line there.

73
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:28,694
Let's say you just have,

74
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:29,704
you've got your point

75
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:31,260
where you're evaluating things,

76
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,907
and then you just have a single vector,

77
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:35,195
and let's actually make it a unit vector.

78
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:36,995
Let's make it the case

79
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:38,620
that this guy has a length of one.

80
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,549
So I'll go over here, and I'll just

81
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:41,105
think of that guy as being V,

82
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:44,022
and say that V has a length of one,

83
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:47,723
so this is our vector.

84
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:48,556
We know now,

85
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:50,555
having learned about the
directional derivative,

86
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:51,809
that you can tell

87
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:53,678
the rate at which the function changes

88
00:02:53,678 --> 00:02:55,548
as you move in this direction

89
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:59,158
by taking a directional derivative

90
00:02:59,158 --> 00:02:59,991
of your function,

91
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:00,824
and let's say this point,

92
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,746
I don't know, what's a
good name for this point?

93
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:03,996
Just like, a,b.

94
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,440
a,b is this point.

95
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:10,528
When you evaluate this at a,b,

96
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:13,905
and the way that you do that

97
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:16,738
is just dotting the gradient of f.

98
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:21,545
I should say dotting it,
evaluate it at that point,

99
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:23,704
'cause gradient is a
vector valued function,

100
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,817
and we just want a specific vector here,

101
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:28,650
so, evaluating that at your point,

102
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:30,700
a,b,

103
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,616
together with whatever the vector is,

104
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,810
whatever that value is,

105
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,577
and in this case we're
thinking of V as a unit vector.

106
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:42,410
So this,

107
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:47,399
this is how you tell the rate of change,

108
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,593
and when I originally introduced
the directional derivative,

109
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:52,879
I gave kind of an indication why.

110
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,398
If you imagine dotting this together with,

111
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:58,458
let's say it was a vector
that's like one two,

112
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,690
really you're thinking
this vector represents

113
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,153
one step in the x direction,

114
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:02,743
two steps in the y direction,

115
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,775
so the amount that it
changes things should be

116
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:06,183
one times the change caused by

117
00:04:06,183 --> 00:04:07,863
a pure step in the x direction,

118
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:10,059
plus two times a change caused by

119
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:11,474
a pure step in the y direction.

120
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:12,856
So that was kind of the loose intuition.

121
00:04:12,856 --> 00:04:14,853
You can see the directional
derivative video

122
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:18,951
if you want a little bit
more discussion on that.

123
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,623
And this is the formula that you have.

124
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:22,359
But this starts to give us the key for

125
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:25,371
how we could choose the
direction of steepest ascent,

126
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:27,124
'cause now, what we're really asking,

127
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:28,947
when we say which one of
these changes things the most,

128
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,863
maybe when you move in that direction

129
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:34,067
it changes f a little bit negatively,

130
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,209
and we want to know,

131
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,042
does another vector W,

132
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,769
is the change caused by
that gonna be positive?

133
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:42,731
Is it gonna be as big as possible?

134
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:45,216
What we're doing is we're saying

135
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:47,076
find the maximum

136
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:48,713
for all unit vectors,

137
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:51,035
so for all vectors V

138
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:53,798
that satisfy the property
that their length is one,

139
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:56,898
find the maximum of the dot product

140
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,289
between f evaluated at that point,

141
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:03,063
evaluated at whatever point we care about,

142
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:03,896
and V.

143
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,722
Find that maximum.

144
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,632
Well, let's just think about

145
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:12,780
what the dot product represents.

146
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,802
So let's say we go over here,

147
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:16,855
and let's say we evaluate
the gradient vector

148
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:18,190
and it turns out that the gradient

149
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,537
points in this direction,

150
00:05:19,537 --> 00:05:21,604
and maybe, it doesn't
have to be a unit vector,

151
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:24,901
it might be something very long like that.

152
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:27,420
So if you imagine some vector V,

153
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,046
some unit vector V,

154
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:32,006
let's say it was taking
off in this direction.

155
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:34,363
The way that you interpret
this dot product,

156
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:36,871
the dot product between the gradient f

157
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,534
and this new vector V,

158
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:41,062
is you would project that vector

159
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:43,698
directly, kind of a
perpendicular projection

160
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:45,207
onto your gradient vector,

161
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:47,204
and you'd say what's that length?

162
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:48,539
What's that length right there?

163
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:49,897
And just as an example,
it would be something

164
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:51,244
a little bit less than one, right?

165
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:52,138
'Cause this is a unit vector.

166
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:55,555
So as an example, let's say that was 0.7.

167
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,472
And then you'd multiply that by the length

168
00:05:58,472 --> 00:05:59,708
of the gradient itself,

169
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,937
of the vector against
which you're dotting,

170
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:04,491
and maybe that guy, maybe the length

171
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,616
of the entire gradient vector,

172
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,729
just, again, as an
example, maybe that's two.

173
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,352
It doesn't have to be,
it could be anything.

174
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:13,881
But the way that you interpret
this whole dot product then

175
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,866
is to take the product of those two.

176
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,449
You would take 0.7,

177
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:20,742
the length of your projection,

178
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:23,841
times the length of the original vector.

179
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,700
And the question is

180
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,838
when is this maximized?

181
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:28,951
What unit vector maximizes this?

182
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:30,135
And if you start to imagine maybe

183
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:32,085
swinging that unit vector around,

184
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:34,082
so if, instead of that guy,

185
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:35,742
you were to use

186
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:39,121
one that pointed a little bit more

187
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:40,456
closely in the direction,

188
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:41,431
then it's projection

189
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:42,360
would be a little bit longer.

190
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,530
Maybe that projection would
be like 0.75 or something.

191
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,004
If you take the unit vector

192
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:49,930
that points directly in the same direction

193
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,287
as that full vector,

194
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,297
then the length of its projection

195
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:55,131
is just the length of the vector itself.

196
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,431
It would be one,

197
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:59,520
because projecting it doesn't
change what it is at all.

198
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,064
So it shouldn't be too
hard to convince yourself,

199
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:04,361
and if you have shaky
intuitions on the dot product,

200
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:06,184
I'd suggest finding the videos we have

201
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,449
on Khan Academy for those.

202
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,449
Sal does a great job
giving that deep intuition.

203
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:13,707
It should kind of make sense why

204
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:16,714
the unit vector that points
in the same direction

205
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:19,396
as your gradient is gonna
be what maximizes it,

206
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:20,406
so the answer here,

207
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,809
the answer to what vector maximizes this

208
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,932
is gonna be, well, it's
the gradient itself, right?

209
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:27,593
It is that gradient vector

210
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:29,543
evaluated at the point we care about,

211
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:30,925
except you'd normalize it, right?

212
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,956
Because we're only
considering unit vectors,

213
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:34,210
so to do that, you just

214
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,335
divide it by whatever it's magnitude is.

215
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:38,378
If its magnitude was
already one, it stays one.

216
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:39,876
If its magnitude was two,

217
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,629
you're dividing it down

218
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,686
by a half.

219
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:43,777
So this is your answer.

220
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,134
This is the direction of steepest ascent.

221
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:48,374
So, I think one thing to notice here

222
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:50,685
is the most fundamental fact

223
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:52,473
is that the gradient is this tool

224
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,423
for computing directional derivatives.

225
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:55,818
You can think of that vector as something

226
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:58,521
that you really want to dot against,

227
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,983
and that's actually a
pretty powerful thought,

228
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:02,399
is that the gradient,
it's not just a vector,

229
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,943
it's a vector that loves to be dotted

230
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,197
together with other things.

231
00:08:05,197 --> 00:08:06,509
That's the fundamental.

232
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:09,551
And as a consequence of that,

233
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:11,502
the direction of steepest ascent

234
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:13,777
is that vector itself

235
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:15,739
because anything, if you're saying

236
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:18,212
what maximizes the dot
product with that thing,

237
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:19,547
it's, well, the vector that points in

238
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:21,544
the same direction as that thing.

239
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,785
And this can also give
us an interpretation

240
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:27,163
for the length of the gradient.

241
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:28,173
We know the direction is the

242
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:29,311
direction of steepest ascent,

243
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,598
but what is the length mean?

244
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:32,736
So, let's give this guy a name.

245
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:35,128
Let's give this normalized
version of it a name.

246
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:37,485
I'm just gonna call it W.

247
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:38,959
So W will be the unit vector

248
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,931
that points in the
direction of the gradient.

249
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:44,497
If you take the directional derivative

250
00:08:44,497 --> 00:08:47,469
in the direction of W of f,

251
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:50,883
what that means is the gradient of f

252
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:52,466
dotted with that W.

253
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,143
And if you kind of spell out

254
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,643
what W means here,

255
00:08:58,313 --> 00:09:01,169
that means you're taking
the gradient of the vector

256
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,363
dotted with itself,

257
00:09:03,363 --> 00:09:05,639
but because it's W and not the gradient,

258
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,508
we're normalizing.

259
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:09,795
We're dividing that,
not by magnitude of f,

260
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:11,014
that doesn't really make sense,

261
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:12,396
but by the value of the gradient,

262
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:13,696
and all of these,

263
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,043
I'm just writing gradient of f,

264
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:16,750
but maybe you should be thinking about

265
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,333
gradient of f evaluated at a,b,

266
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:21,823
but I'm just being kind of lazy,

267
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:24,146
and just writing gradient of f.

268
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,199
And the top, when you take
the dot product with itself,

269
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,149
what that means is

270
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:31,482
the square of its magnitude.

271
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,850
But the whole thing is
divided by the magnitude.

272
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:41,479
So you can kind of cancel that out.

273
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:44,323
You could say this
doesn't need to be there,

274
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:46,320
that exponent doesn't need to be there,

275
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,897
and basically, the directional derivative

276
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:52,167
in the direction of the gradient itself

277
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,499
has a value equal to the
magnitude of the gradient.

278
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:58,889
So this tells you when you're
moving in that direction,

279
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,305
in the direction of the gradient,

280
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:02,140
the rate at which the function changes

281
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,671
is given by the magnitude of the gradient.

282
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,296
So it's this really magical vector.

283
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:07,129
It does a lot of things.

284
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:10,000
It's the tool that lets you
dot against other vectors

285
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,706
to tell you the directional derivative.

286
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:14,307
As a consequence, it's the
direction of steepest ascent,

287
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,466
and its magnitude tells
you the rate at which

288
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,336
things change while you're moving in that

289
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:19,764
direction of steepest ascent.

290
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,264
It's just really a

291
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:25,418
core part of scalar valued
multi-variable functions,

292
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:28,181
and it is the extension of the derivative

293
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:31,625
in every sense that you could
want a derivative to extend.
