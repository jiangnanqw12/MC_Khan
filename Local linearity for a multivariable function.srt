00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:01,420
- [Tutor] So, a lot of the concepts

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,784
that you learn about in
multi-variable calculus,

3
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:06,082
are really all about
ideas that you originally

4
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:08,313
might've learned in linear algebra,

5
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:11,812
and then transferring those to
apply to nonlinear problems.

6
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,349
So for example, I'm gonna
give you a function,

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,494
some kind of function that
takes in a 2D vector, xy,

8
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:21,806
and it's also going to
spit out a 2D vector,

9
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:23,879
and the specific one I have in mind,

10
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,046
this is just kind of
arbitrary, is x plus sin of y,

11
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,751
and then, because I'm
a sucker for symmetry,

12
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:34,501
I'm gonna make it y plus sin of x.

13
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,677
Though of course, this could
be any arbitrary function,

14
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:39,108
you don't need that kind of symmetry.

15
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:40,997
So, in the last video, I
gave a little refresher

16
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,229
on how to think about
linear transformations

17
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:45,056
and ideas from linear algebra,

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,964
and how you encode a linear
transformation using a matrix,

19
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,409
and kind of visualize it, I use this grid,

20
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:53,247
and here, I wanna show what
this function looks like

21
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:55,413
as a transformation of space.

22
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:57,092
As in, I'm gonna tell the computer,

23
00:00:57,092 --> 00:01:00,080
take every single point
on this blue grid here,

24
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,187
and if that point is xy, I want you

25
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,956
to move it over to the
point x plus sin of y,

26
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:06,642
y plus sin of x.

27
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:09,914
And here's what that looks like.

28
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:13,046
Alright, so things get
really wavy, really curly,

29
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:15,459
this is not at all a
linear transformation,

30
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:17,301
all of the lines don't remain lines,

31
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:19,832
they're no longer nice grid
lines that are parallel

32
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:22,058
and evenly spaced, in some sense,

33
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:24,031
there is much, much more information

34
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:25,654
that goes into nonlinear functions

35
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:27,810
than into linear functions.

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,383
And because this is rather complicated,

37
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:31,591
I think it might be easy
to see what's going on

38
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,224
if we just focus on a
single individual point.

39
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:38,032
So let me look at a point
like, hmm, let's say,

40
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,615
pi/2 and zero, okay?

41
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:46,164
So if that's what I'm
plugging in, x is pi/2,

42
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:50,495
so at the top here, x
stays the same, it's pi/2,

43
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:52,684
and then sin of y would be sin of zero,

44
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:57,035
so that x component is gonna
completely stay the same.

45
00:01:57,035 --> 00:02:00,747
And then for the bottom,
y, or y is also zero,

46
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:04,391
plus sin of x, sin of
pi/2 is one, and just,

47
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,755
I'll go ahead and write sin of pi/2,

48
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:10,922
sin of pi/2, but you can think
of that as just being one.

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,054
So what that means on the
transformation over here,

50
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,419
is if we look at the point
that's at pi/2, zero,

51
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,098
and pi/2 is a little about 1.5,

52
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:22,612
so that's gonna be around here,

53
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:25,807
we expect it to move
to the point pi/2, one.

54
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:28,785
So it should just move
vertically by one unit,

55
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:30,725
and if you just focus on that one point

56
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:33,624
during the transformation,
notice that's exactly

57
00:02:33,624 --> 00:02:37,207
what happens, it just
moves vertically one point.

58
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,525
And of course, things
are quite complicated

59
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,237
because every point is doing that, right?

60
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:41,789
The computer's taking in every point

61
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,580
and moving it to where it should go.

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,201
So, after having given the refresher

63
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,981
on thinking about linear transformations

64
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:49,613
and encoding them with matrices last time,

65
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:52,763
something like this might
feel completely intractable.

66
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:54,729
You certainly have to
store much more information

67
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:58,510
than just four numbers to
record where everything goes.

68
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,304
But this function has a nice property,

69
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:01,865
a property that we deal with all the time

70
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:03,570
in multi-variable calculus.

71
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,119
It's what we call locally linear.

72
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,369
Locally linear.

73
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:13,855
And what that means is if I
was to take our initial setup,

74
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:15,569
and then zoom in on a given point,

75
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,101
so I'm gonna zoom in around
this point on the left here,

76
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:20,229
and this box, kind of in the upper right,

77
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:22,380
just shows the zoomed-in version of that.

78
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,880
And first of all, I'm gonna
add some more grid lines,

79
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,507
so they're really very close grid lines,

80
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,421
we can see from the zoomed-out picture,

81
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,481
but this just makes it so
that when we're zoomed in,

82
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:32,954
we can see a little bit
more of what's going on.

83
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:34,956
And now, when I play the animation,

84
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:37,642
I'm gonna have this yellow
box that's doing the zooming

85
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:41,309
follow the point at its center,
so this box will be moving,

86
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:44,099
and we're always just gonna
look at what it zoomed in on,

87
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:44,932
'kay?

88
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,693
So it's gonna be following
what's going on around that point

89
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,633
during the transformation.

90
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:52,424
And we can see, inside
this zoomed version,

91
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:55,118
it's still not linear, the
lines get a little bit curved,

92
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:57,671
but this looks a lot more
like a linear function,

93
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,416
it looks a lot more like the grid lines

94
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,643
that started off horizontal and vertical,

95
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:04,230
are remaining parallel and evenly spaced.

96
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,096
And in fact, let's say
I zoom in even further,

97
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:09,542
to an even smaller yellow
box here, and again,

98
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:12,016
I'm gonna add in some more
grid lines right around it,

99
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:13,373
so they're very, very densely packed.

100
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:16,405
And this is purely an artifact
of visualizing things,

101
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:18,634
I could choose to put
points or lines or anything

102
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,224
wherever I want, and I just
think showing the grid lines

103
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:23,066
and only the grid lines
and where they move,

104
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,366
gives sort of a feel for
what the function is doing.

105
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:28,613
So this time, when I play
it, and that zooming-in box

106
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:31,949
kind of tracks the point
that we're looking at,

107
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,143
as it goes, the neighborhood around it,

108
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:37,567
all of the points around
it, really, really do look

109
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,434
like a linear function.

110
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:41,411
And the more you zoom
in, the more it looks

111
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:44,133
precisely like a certain linear function.

112
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,688
Oh, I guess I should've
written an r over here.

113
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:47,893
Locally linear.

114
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:50,401
So this raises the question,
if we're looking around

115
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:54,568
some specific point, which I'll
call x nought and y nought,

116
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:58,711
this should correspond in some way

117
00:04:58,711 --> 00:05:01,256
to the linear transformation
that it looks like around it.

118
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:03,305
There should be some kind of matrix,

119
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:05,997
some two-by-two matrix, that represents

120
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:08,747
the linear transformation
that this function,

121
00:05:08,747 --> 00:05:11,365
this much more complicated
function, looks like

122
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,074
around that point.

123
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:15,728
So this idea of zooming in
is what we mean by local,

124
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,390
and in the next video, I'm gonna show you

125
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,693
what this matrix looks like in
terms of partial derivatives

126
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:21,967
for our original function.

127
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:22,800
See you then!
