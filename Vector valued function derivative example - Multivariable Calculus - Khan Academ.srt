1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,560
what i want to do in this video is to

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,560
make two parametrizations of essentially

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,880
the same curve but we're going to go

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,320
along the curve at different rates and

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,719
hopefully we'll be able to use that to

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,559
understand or get a better intuition

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,279
behind what exactly it means to take a

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,199
derivative of a position vector valued

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,960
function so let's say my first

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,039
parametrization i have x of t

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,199
is equal to t

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:32,800
and let's say that y of t is equal to t

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,559
squared and this is true for

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,000
t is greater than or equal to 0

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,040
and less than or equal to

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,559
2.

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,960
and if i want to write this as a

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,079
position vector valued function let me

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,160
write this x1 let me call that y1 and

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,360
let me write my position vector valued

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,079
function

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,120
i could say r1 because i'm numbering

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,879
them because i'm going to do a different

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,440
version of this exact same curve with a

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,239
slightly different parametrization so r

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,879
one of t we could say is x one of t

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,479
times i the position the unit vector i

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,479
so we'll just say t

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,400
times i

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,720
plus right this is just x of t right

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
here or x one of t that's the i'm

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,040
numbering them because i later have an

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,920
x2 of t

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,000
plus

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,880
t squared plus t squared times

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,439
j

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,880
and if i wanted to if i wanted to graph

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,000
this i'm going to be very careful

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,680
graphing it because i really want to

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,560
understand what the derivative means

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,479
here

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
so let me get my

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,640
draw

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
try to draw

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
roughly to scale

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,680
so

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
let's say that this is

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,720
so we get 1

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,920
two

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,960
three

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,079
four

52
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,399
and then let me draw my x-axis

53
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,320
that's good enough and my x-axis i want

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,000
it to be roughly to scale one

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,920
and two

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,759
and so at t equals zero both my x and y

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
coordinates are at zero or this is just

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,840
going to be the zero vector so this is

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,640
where we are at t equals zero at t

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,479
equals one this is going to be one times

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,520
i so we're going to be just like that

62
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,319
plus 1 times j right 1 squared is j so

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,879
we're going to be right there

64
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,760
and then at t is equal to 2

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,400
we're going to be at 2i so 2i you can

66
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,400
imagine 2 times i would be this vector

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,360
right there

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,319
right 2 times i plus 4 right 2 squared

69
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,160
is 4 4 times j so plus

70
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,920
plus this plus 4 times j right that's 4

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,840
times j if you add these two vectors

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,599
heads to tails you're going to get a

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,680
vector that goes

74
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,800
that endpoint is right there the vector

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,000
is going to look something like this

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,680
i don't want to

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,040
so this is what

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,680
just to make it clear what we're doing

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,000
that's r 1 of 2 right this is r 1 of 0

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,760
this is r 1 of 1. but the bottom line is

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,040
the path looks like this it's a bit it's

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,959
a parabola

83
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,480
so the path will look

84
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,280
like

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,959
that

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,120
just like that

87
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,640
now that's in my first parameterization

88
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,159
of it actually let me draw a little bit

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,519
more carefully i want to get rid of this

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,120
arrows just because i want to be a nice

91
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,560
clean drawing

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,159
so my it's going to be a probable well

93
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
that's that as

94
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,360
let me get rid of that other point too

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,720
just because it i didn't draw it exactly

96
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,159
where it needs to be it needs to be

97
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,920
right there

98
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,400
and my parabola or my part of my

99
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,040
parabola is going to look something like

100
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,799
that all right good enough so this is

101
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,159
the part the first parameterization i'm

102
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,080
going to do this exact same curve but

103
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,519
i'm going to do it slightly differently

104
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,560
so let's say i'll do it in different

105
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,440
colors

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,879
so x 2 of t let's say it equals 2t

107
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,560
and y

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,440
2 of t let's say it's equal to 2

109
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,480
t

110
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,519
squared or we could alternatively write

111
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,200
that that's the same thing as 4 t

112
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,519
squared just phrasing both of these guys

113
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
to the second power that's equal to 4t

114
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,959
squared i could write it either way and

115
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,720
then let's say my second

116
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,000
parameterization and let's say instead

117
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,280
of going from t equals 0 to 2 we're

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
going to go from t goes from 0

119
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,239
to

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,360
1. t goes from 0 to 1. we're going to

121
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,439
see it's going to we're going to cover

122
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,959
the exact same path

123
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,199
and our second

124
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,560
vector val or position vector valued

125
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,239
function

126
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
r two

127
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,560
of t

128
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,240
is going to be equal to

129
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,520
two t

130
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,360
times i

131
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:35,360
plus i could say 2t squared or 4t

132
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,639
squared times j and if i were to graph

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,080
this guy right here it will look like

134
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,919
let me draw my axes again

135
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,680
it's going to look the same but

136
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,360
it's i think useful to draw it because

137
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
i'm going to draw these the derivatives

138
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,160
and all of that on it later so let's see

139
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,040
one

140
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,919
two

141
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,680
three

142
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,639
four

143
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
one

144
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,919
two

145
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,199
and then let's see what happens when t

146
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:05,280
is equal to 0 when t is equal to 0

147
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,440
or r of 0 this all of these are going to

148
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,680
be 0 we just got the zero vector x and y

149
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,160
are both equal to 0.

150
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,960
when t is equal to

151
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,639
one half so when t is equal to one half

152
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
what are we going to get here one half

153
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,280
times two is one

154
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,520
and then we're going to get the point uh

155
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,520
one half squared is one fourth times 4

156
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,080
is 1. so when t is equal to 1 half we're

157
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,520
going to be at the point 1 1

158
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,440
and when t is equal to 1 we're going to

159
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,639
be the point 2

160
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,080
4

161
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,440
right 2

162
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,160
4.

163
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,160
so notice the curve is exactly the path

164
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,320
we go is exactly the same

165
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,639
but before we even do the derivatives

166
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,639
these two paths are identical i want to

167
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,240
think about something let's pretend that

168
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,080
our parameter t really is time that t is

169
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,039
equal to time and that tends to be the

170
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,039
most common that's why they call it t

171
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,520
it doesn't have to be time but let's say

172
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,680
it is time so what's happening here in

173
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,960
this first parametrization when we go

174
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,560
from zero to two seconds we cover this

175
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,240
path right you can imagine after one

176
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,680
second the dot moves here then it moves

177
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,199
there you can imagine a dot moving along

178
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,840
this curve and it takes two seconds to

179
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,759
do so in this situation we have a dot

180
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,319
moving along the same curve but it's

181
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,479
able to cover the same curve in only one

182
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,639
second and half a second it gets here it

183
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,080
took this guy one second to get here in

184
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,680
one second this guy's all the way over

185
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
here this guy takes two seconds to go

186
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,600
over here so in this second

187
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,919
parameterization even though the path is

188
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,759
the same the curves are the same

189
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,840
the dot is faster dot is

190
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,800
faster and i want you to keep that in

191
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,360
mind when we think about the derivatives

192
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,479
of both of these position vector valued

193
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,400
functions

194
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,479
so just remember the dot is moving

195
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
faster for every second it's getting

196
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,120
it's getting further along the curve

197
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,960
than here that's what only took them one

198
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,680
second now let's look at the derivatives

199
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,160
of both of these guys

200
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,120
so the derivative here so if i were to

201
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
write

202
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
r

203
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,319
prime

204
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,840
r prime r one prime of t let me do a

205
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,520
different color actually i already used

206
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,199
the orange

207
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,199
so let me do it

208
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,120
in a blue

209
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,599
r one

210
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,639
prime of t so this is the derivative now

211
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,240
is going to be remember it's just the

212
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,319
derivative of each of these times the

213
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,479
unit vectors so the derivative of

214
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,520
of t with respect to t that's just 1 so

215
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,560
it's 1 times i so i'll just write 1

216
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,639
i

217
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,720
plus i didn't have to write the 1 there

218
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,479
plus the derivative of t squared with

219
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,440
respect to t is 2t plus 2

220
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,319
t

221
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,720
j

222
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,440
and let me take the derivative over here

223
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,400
r

224
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,160
2

225
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,160
prime of t

226
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,479
the derivative of two t with respect to

227
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
t is two so two i

228
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,319
plus the derivative of four t squared is

229
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,599
eight t

230
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,879
right two times four it is

231
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,879
it is eight t

232
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
8

233
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,759
t

234
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,199
just like that

235
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,680
just like that

236
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,520
now the question is

237
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,360
what do their what do their respective

238
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,879
derivative vectors look like at

239
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,479
different points so let's look at i

240
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,199
don't know let's see let's see how fast

241
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,639
they're moving when time is equal to 1.

242
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,240
so let's take

243
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,160
let's take a specific point this is just

244
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,840
the general formula but let's take it

245
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,800
let's figure out what the derivative is

246
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,840
at a specific point so let's take r

247
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
one

248
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,520
when time is equal to

249
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,159
when time is equal to one and i wanna

250
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,120
take the specific point on the curve not

251
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,640
the specific point in time so this point

252
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,360
on the curve here is when time is equal

253
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,479
to one you could say second this point

254
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,080
over here which is the exact

255
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,320
corresponding point is when time is

256
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,000
equal to one half second so r one of one

257
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,800
is equal to and we're taking the

258
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,600
derivative there is equal to one i right

259
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,480
it's not dependent on t at all so it's 1

260
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
i

261
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,880
plus

262
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,839
2 times 1 j so plus 2

263
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,440
j

264
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,320
so at this point

265
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,040
the derivative of or the derivative of

266
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,160
our position vector function is going to

267
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,120
be 1i plus 2j so we can draw it like

268
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,360
this so if we do 1i is like this 1i

269
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,600
and then 2j just 2j is like that

270
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,279
so our derivative right there i'll do it

271
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,640
in the same color that i wrote it in in

272
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,000
this green color it's going to look like

273
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,080
this

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,080
it's going to look like that

275
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,680
and notice it looks like at least its

276
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,720
direction is let me do it a little bit

277
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,440
straighter

278
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,399
its direction

279
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,880
that's not even its direction

280
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,560
looks tangent to the curve it's going in

281
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,680
the direction that my particle is moving

282
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,279
remember my particle's going from here

283
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,560
to there so it's going in the direction

284
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,959
and i'm going to think about in a second

285
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,040
what this length of this derivative

286
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,519
vector is this right here just to be

287
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,240
clear is r one

288
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,040
prime it's a vector so it's the it's

289
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,079
it's telling us the instantaneous change

290
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,200
in our position vector with respect to t

291
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,120
or time

292
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,959
when time is equal to one second that's

293
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,519
this thing right here now let's take the

294
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,640
exact same position here on our curve

295
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,839
but that's going to occur at a different

296
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,040
time for this guy we already said it

297
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,880
only takes him

298
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,640
he's here at time is equal to one half

299
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,680
second so let's take

300
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,760
let's take

301
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,800
let me do it in i can do the same color

302
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,440
so here we have r2

303
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,040
r2 we're going to evaluate it one half

304
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,200
because at time is equal to one half

305
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,680
seconds and this is going to be equal to

306
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,360
2i this isn't dependent at all on time

307
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,399
so two

308
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,120
i

309
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,640
plus eight times the time so we're eight

310
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,640
time right here is one half so eight

311
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,480
times one half is four

312
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,480
so plus four

313
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
j so what does this look like

314
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,920
the instantaneous derivative here and

315
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,959
this is the derivative have to be very

316
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,600
clear so 2i that's let me draw some more

317
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,079
so 2i maybe gets us about

318
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,279
that far plus 4j

319
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,880
will get us up to right around there

320
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,720
plus 4j

321
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,160
is that vector so when you add those two

322
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
heads to tails

323
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,399
you get this thing

324
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,600
you get something that let me let me do

325
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,680
it like

326
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,680
you get something that looks like that

327
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,360
is something that looks like that i

328
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,399
didn't draw it as neatly as i would like

329
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,480
to but let's notice something

330
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,160
both of these vectors are going in the

331
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,800
exact same direction they're both

332
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,920
tangential to the path to our curve but

333
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,800
this vector is going is is its length

334
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,040
its magnitude is much larger than this

335
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,480
vector's magnitude and that makes sense

336
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,920
because i hinted at it when we first

337
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,000
talked about these vector valued

338
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,760
position functions and their derivatives

339
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,839
is that the length

340
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,560
the length

341
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,240
you can kind of view it as the speed the

342
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,920
length is equal to the speed if you

343
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,760
imagine time t being time and these

344
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,839
parametrizations are representing a dot

345
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,760
moving along these curves so in this

346
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,360
case the particle only takes a second to

347
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,760
go there so at this point in its path

348
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,000
it's moving much faster than this

349
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,800
particle is so if you think about it

350
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,279
this vector right here if you imagine

351
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,720
this is a position vector this is

352
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,880
velocity

353
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,639
this right here is velocity right

354
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,279
velocity is

355
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,040
a speed plus direction speed is just you

356
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,880
know how fast are you going velocity is

357
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,600
how fast you're going in what direction

358
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,120
i'm going this fast in and you could

359
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,760
calculate it using pythagorean theorem

360
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,320
but i just want to give you the

361
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,399
intuition right here i'm going that fast

362
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
in this direction here i'm going this

363
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,480
fast i'm going even faster that's my

364
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,560
magnitude but i'm still going in the

365
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,040
same direction so hopefully you have a

366
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,040
gut feeling now of what the derivative

367
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,040
of these position vectors really are
