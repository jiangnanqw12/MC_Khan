1
00:00:00,364 --> 00:00:01,688
- [Voiceover] So in the
last couple of videos,

2
00:00:01,688 --> 00:00:03,523
I talked about the
multi-variable chain rule,

3
00:00:03,523 --> 00:00:04,751
which I have up here, and if you

4
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:06,628
haven't seen those go take a look.

5
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:09,063
Here and I want to write
it out in vector notation,

6
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:11,466
and this helps us generalize
it a little bit when

7
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:15,260
the intermediary space is a
little bit higher dimensional.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,944
So, instead of writing X of T and

9
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:21,211
Y of T as separate functions,
and just trying to emphasize

10
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:23,015
"oh they have the same input space, and

11
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:25,869
whatever X takes in that's
the same number Y takes in."

12
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:28,444
It's better and a little bit cleaner

13
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:32,037
if we say there's a vector valued function

14
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:33,737
that takes in a single number "T,"

15
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:36,808
then it outputs some kind of vector.

16
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:38,228
In this case you could say the components

17
00:00:38,228 --> 00:00:41,895
of V are X of T and Y
of T, and that's fine.

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,459
But I want to talk about
what this looks like

19
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:52,372
if we start writing
everything in vector notation,

20
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:56,566
and just since we see
DX/DT here and DY/DT here,

21
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:59,072
you might start thinking,
"oh we should take

22
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:03,664
the derivative of that
vector valued function."

23
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:07,441
The derivative of V, with respect to T,

24
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,120
and when we compute this
it's nothing more than

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,603
taking the derivatives of each component.

26
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:13,785
So in this case, the derivative of X,

27
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:17,952
so you'd write DX/DT,
and the derivative of Y,

28
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:23,418
DY/DT. This is the
vector value derivative.

29
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:26,940
And now you might start
to notice something here.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,258
Okay so we've got one of
those components multiplied

31
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:31,318
by a certain value and
another component multiplied

32
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:33,355
by a certain value, you might

33
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,022
recognize this as a dot product.

34
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:39,129
This would be the dot product between the

35
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:41,005
vector that contains the derivatives,

36
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:45,172
the partial derivatives,
partial of F with respect to Y,

37
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:49,355
partial of F with respect to X, oh,

38
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:52,766
whoops, don't know why
I wrote it that way,

39
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:56,933
but up here that's with respect
to X, and then here to Y.

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,261
So this whole thing, we're
taking the dot product

41
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:07,428
with the vector that contains
ordinary derivative DX/DT

42
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,711
and ordinary derivative DY/DT.

43
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:16,653
And of course both of
these are special vectors,

44
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:19,667
they're not just random, the left one,

45
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:24,496
that's the gradient of F,
and the right vector here

46
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:25,755
that's what we just wrote that's

47
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:28,217
the derivative of V with respect to T,

48
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:32,423
just for being quick I'm gonna
write that as V prime of T.

49
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:35,371
That's saying completely
the same thing as VDVT,

50
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:37,712
and this right here is
another way to write

51
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:39,700
the multi-variable chain rule,

52
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,349
and maybe if you were being
a little bit more exact

53
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,481
you would emphasize that when
you take the gradient of F

54
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:47,253
the thing that you input
into it is the output

55
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:48,771
of that vector valued function,

56
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:51,379
you know you're throwing
in X of T and Y of T,

57
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,895
so you might emphasize
that you take in that

58
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:57,054
as an input, and then
you multiply it by the

59
00:02:57,054 --> 00:03:01,221
derivative, the vector
valued derivative of V of T.

60
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,325
And when I say multiply,
I mean dot product, right,

61
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:07,317
these are vectors and you're
taking the dot product,

62
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,646
it should seem very familiar to, you know,

63
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:11,790
the single-variable chain rule.

64
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,823
And just to remind us
I'll throw it up here,

65
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:18,264
if you take the derivative
of composition of

66
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,347
two single-variable functions F of G,

67
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:26,625
you take the derivative
of the outside F prime,

68
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:30,792
and throw in G, throw in what
was the interior function,

69
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:32,778
and you multiply it by the

70
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:36,568
derivative of that interior
function, G prime of T.

71
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:38,331
And this is super helpful
in single-variable calculus

72
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:40,437
for computing a lot of derivatives,

73
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,579
and over here it has a
very similar form right?

74
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,029
The gradient which really
serves the function

75
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:47,926
of the true extension
of the derivative for

76
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:50,736
multi-variable functions for
scalar valued multi-variable

77
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:53,543
functions at least. You
take that derivative

78
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:56,428
and throw in the inner function,

79
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:58,253
which just happens to be
a vector valued function.

80
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:00,222
You throw it in there,
and then you multiply it

81
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:02,526
by the derivative of that,
but multiplying vectors

82
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:06,487
in this context means taking
the dot product of the two,

83
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:07,550
and this could mean if you have a function

84
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,191
with a whole bunch of different variables,

85
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:13,024
let's say you have some
F of X, or not F of X,

86
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,154
F of X1 and X2 and it takes in a

87
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:23,411
whole bunch of variables
that it goes out to X100.

88
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:28,222
And then what you throw into
it is the vector value function

89
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:32,305
that's vector valued,
takes in a single variable,

90
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:36,343
and in order to be able to compose them

91
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,359
it's gonna have a whole bunch
of intermediary functions,

92
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:43,312
and you can write it as X1, X2,
X3, all the way up to X100 ,

93
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:45,289
and these are all functions at this point.

94
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:49,036
These are component functions
of your vector valued V.

95
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:51,175
This expression still makes sense, right?

96
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:53,130
You can still take the gradient of F,

97
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,099
it's gonna have 100
components, you can plug

98
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:58,876
in any vector, any set
of 100 different numbers,

99
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:00,819
and in particular the output of a

100
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:03,348
vector valued function with
100 different components

101
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,153
is gonna work, and then
you take the dot product

102
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:07,801
with the derivative of
this. That's the more

103
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:11,284
general version of the
multi-variable chain rule,

104
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:13,005
and then the cool way
about writing it like this,

105
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:16,902
you can interpret it in terms
of the directional derivative,

106
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:19,012
and I think I'll do
that in the next video,

107
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:22,019
so, that's a certain way to interpret

108
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:24,309
this with a directional derivative.
