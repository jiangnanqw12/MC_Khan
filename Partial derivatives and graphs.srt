00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:02,370
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,504
So I have here the graph
of a two-variable function

3
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:07,385
and I'd like to talk about
how you can interpret

4
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:09,428
the partial derivative of that function.

5
00:00:09,428 --> 00:00:11,253
So specifically, the function

6
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:14,170
that you're looking at is f of x, y

7
00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:18,786
is equal to x squared times y

8
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,036
plus sine of y.

9
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:23,732
And the question is, if I
take the partial derivative

10
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,263
of this function, so maybe I'm looking at

11
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:30,024
the partial derivative
of f with respect to x,

12
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:32,927
and let's say I want to do
this at negative one, one

13
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:34,599
so I'll be looking at
the partial derivative

14
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:35,899
at a specific point.

15
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:38,425
How do you interpret
that on this whole graph?

16
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:41,495
First, let's consider where
the point negative one, one is.

17
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:42,702
If we're looking above,

18
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:45,234
this is our x-axis, this is our y-axis

19
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:46,557
the point negative one, one

20
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:47,579
is sitting right there.

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,367
So negative one, move up one

22
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:52,037
and it's the point that's
sitting on the graph.

23
00:00:52,037 --> 00:00:53,580
And the first thing you might do

24
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,636
is you say well, when we're
taking the partial derivative

25
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:57,552
with respect to x, we're going to pretend

26
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:59,096
that y is a constant

27
00:00:59,096 --> 00:01:02,207
so let's actually just go
ahead and evaluate that.

28
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:04,761
When you're doing this,

29
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:06,898
x squared looks like a variable,

30
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:08,267
y looks like a constant,

31
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:10,856
sine of y also looks like a constant.

32
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,470
So this is going to be...

33
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,560
We differentiate x squared

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,927
and that's two times x times
y which is like a constant,

35
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:20,551
and then the derivative of
a constant there is zero

36
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:22,966
and we're evaluating this whole thing

37
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:27,133
at x is equal to negative
one and y is equal to one.

38
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:30,153
So when we actually plug that in,

39
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:34,320
it would be two times negative
one multiplied by one,

40
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,150
which is two... Negative two, excuse me.

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,218
But what does that mean, right?

42
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:42,517
We evaluate this, and
maybe you're thinking

43
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:44,375
this is kind of slight
nudge in the x direction,

44
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,930
this is the resulting nudge of f.

45
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,370
What does that mean for the graph?

46
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,553
Well first of all,
treating y as a constant

47
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:52,084
is basically like slicing the whole graph

48
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:54,800
with a plane that represents
a constant y value.

49
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,124
So this is the y-axis,

50
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:58,190
and the plane that cuts it perpendicularly

51
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,559
that represents a constant y value.

52
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,835
This one represents the
constant y value one

53
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:06,875
but you could imagine sliding
the plane back and forth

54
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:10,237
and that would represent
various different y values.

55
00:02:10,237 --> 00:02:12,378
So for the general partial derivative,

56
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:14,479
you can imagine whichever one you want

57
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,465
but this one is y equals one

58
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:19,344
and I'll go ahead and slice
the actual graph at that point

59
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:21,011
and draw a red line.

60
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:23,241
And this red line is basically

61
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:26,941
all the points on the graph
where y is equal to one.

62
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:31,820
So I'll emphasize that...
where y is equal to one.

63
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,987
This is y is equal to one.

64
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:37,371
So, when we're looking at that

65
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:40,102
we can actually interpret the
partial derivative as a slope

66
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:42,703
because we're looking at the point here,

67
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:44,267
we're asking how the function changes

68
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:46,279
as we move in the x direction.

69
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:48,353
From single variable calculus,
you might be familiar

70
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:50,621
with thinking of that
as the slope of a line

71
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:52,734
and to be a little more
concrete about this,

72
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:54,411
I could say you're starting here,

73
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:58,075
you consider some nudge over
there, just some tiny step.

74
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,538
I'm drawing it as a sizable one

75
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:02,835
but you imagine it as a
really small step, as your dx,

76
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:05,250
and then the distance
to your function here

77
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,850
the change in the value
of your function...

78
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,332
I said dx, but I should say
partial x or del x... Partial f.

79
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:14,765
And as that tiny nudge
gets smaller and smaller,

80
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:16,720
this change here is going to correspond

81
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,544
with what the tangent
line does, and that's why

82
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:22,665
you have this rise over
run feeling for the slope.

83
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:24,831
And you look at that
value, and the line itself

84
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,937
looks like it has a slope
of about negative two

85
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:28,728
so it should actually
make sense that we get

86
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:32,742
negative two over here
given what we're looking at.

87
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:33,883
But let's do this

88
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:35,933
with the partial derivative
with respect to y.

89
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:39,266
Let's erase what we've got going on here

90
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,795
and I'll go ahead and move
the graph back to what it was,

91
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:45,931
get rid of these guys,

92
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:48,439
so now we're no longer
slicing with respect to y,

93
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,606
but instead let's say we slice
it with a constant x value.

94
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,778
So this here is the x-axis;
this plane represents

95
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,795
the constant value x equals negative one

96
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,581
and we can slice the graph there.

97
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:03,787
Kind of slice it, I'll
draw the red line again

98
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,529
that represents the curve

99
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:08,245
and this time, that curve represents

100
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:11,245
that value x equals negative one.

101
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,702
It's all the points on the graph

102
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,583
where x equals negative one.

103
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,464
And now when we take
the partial derivative,

104
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:19,391
we're going to interpret it as a slice...

105
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,474
As the slope of this resulting curve.

106
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,148
So that slope ends up looking like this,

107
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:28,097
that's our blue line, and
let's go ahead and evaluate

108
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:31,442
the partial derivative
of f with respect to y.

109
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:34,692
So I'll go over here,
use a different color

110
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:38,859
so the partial derivative of f
with respect to y, partial y.

111
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:42,732
So we go up here, and it says,
okay. So x squared times y.

112
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:45,305
It's considering x squared
to be a constant now.

113
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:47,162
So it looks at that and
says x, you're a constant,

114
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,600
y, you're the variable,
constant times a variable,

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,083
the derivative is just
equal to that constant.

116
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,833
So that x squared.

117
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,029
And over here, sine of y,

118
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:00,003
the derivative of that with respect to y

119
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:01,003
is cosine y.

120
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:02,944
Cosine y.

121
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:06,388
And if we actually want to evaluate this

122
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:08,037
at our point negative one, one

123
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:11,120
what we'd get is negative one squared

124
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:13,636
plus cosine of one.

125
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:17,789
And I'm not sure what the cosine of one is

126
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,461
but it's something a little bit positive,

127
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,551
and the ultimate result that we see here

128
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:24,105
is going to be one plus something,

129
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:26,566
I don't know what it is,
but it's something positive,

130
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:28,019
and that should make sense
'cause we look at the slope here

131
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,604
and it's a little bit more than one.

132
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:31,829
I'm not sure exactly, but it's
a little bit more than one.

133
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:33,068
So you often hear about people

134
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,693
talking about the partial derivative

135
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:37,456
as being the slope of
the slice of a graph.

136
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:38,647
Which is great,

137
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:40,064
if you're looking at a function that has

138
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:42,395
a two-variable input and
a one-variable output,

139
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:44,399
so that we can think about its graph.

140
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,116
And in other contexts,
that might not be the case.

141
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:49,926
Maybe it's something that has
a multidimensional output,

142
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:50,947
we'll talk about that later,

143
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:52,341
when you have a vector-valued function,

144
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:54,245
what its partial derivative looks like,

145
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:57,449
but maybe it's also something
that has a hundred inputs

146
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,539
and you certainly can't
visualize the graph

147
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,187
but the general idea of saying,

148
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:03,403
"Well, if you take a tiny
step in a direction"--

149
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:04,438
here, I'll actually walk through it

150
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:06,272
in this graph's context again.

151
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:08,571
You're looking at your point here

152
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,173
and you say we're going
to take a tiny step

153
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:11,903
in the y direction.

154
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:14,167
And I'll call that partial y.

155
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,375
And you say that makes
some kind of change,

156
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,836
it causes a change in the function

157
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,856
which you'll call partial f.

158
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,876
And as you imagine this
getting really really small,

159
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:24,531
and the resulting change
also getting really small

160
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,431
the rise over run of
that is going to give you

161
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:28,355
the slope of the tangent line.

162
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,375
So this is just one way of
interpreting that ratio,

163
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,606
the change in the output

164
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:33,974
that corresponds to a
little nudge in the input.

165
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:35,282
But later on we'll talk
about different ways

166
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:36,575
that you can do that.

167
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,920
So I think graphs are
very useful (laughs)...

168
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,936
When I move that, the text doesn't move.

169
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:43,273
I think graphs are very
useful for thinking

170
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:45,445
about these things, but
they're not the only way

171
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:47,534
and I don't want you to
get too attached to graphs

172
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:49,088
even though they can be handy

173
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:53,036
in the context of two-variable
input, one-variable output.

174
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:53,869
See you next video!
