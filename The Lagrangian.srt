1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
all right so today i'm going to be

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,359
talking about the lagrangian

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,279
now we've talked about lagrange

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,440
multipliers this is a highly related

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,280
concept in fact it's not really teaching

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,880
anything new this is just repackaging

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,480
stuff that we already know

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,160
so to remind you of the setup this is

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,160
going to be a constrained optimization

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,400
problem setup so we'll have some kind of

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,320
multi-variable function

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,119
f of x y and the one i have pictured

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,240
here

14
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,760
is

15
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,960
let's see it's

16
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,880
x squared

17
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,519
times e to the y

18
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,399
times y so what i've shown here is a

19
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,719
contour line for this function so that

20
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,800
is we say what happens if we set this

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,040
equal to some constant and we ask about

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,719
all values of x and y such that this

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,399
holds such that this function outputs

24
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,160
that constant and if i choose a

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,840
different constant that contour line

26
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,840
could look a little bit different it's

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,440
kind of nice that it has similar shapes

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,600
so that's that's the function and we're

29
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,680
trying to maximize it the goal is to

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,280
maximize this guy

31
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,640
and of course it's not just that the

32
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,480
reason we call it a constrained

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,120
optimization problem is because there's

34
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,840
some kind of constraint some kind of

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,280
other function g of x y

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
in this case

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,240
x squared

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,320
plus y squared

39
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,320
and we want to say that this has to

40
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,560
equal some specific amount in this case

41
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,400
i'm going to set it equal to 4. so we

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,479
say you can't look at any x y to

43
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,720
maximize this function you're limited to

44
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,920
the values of x and y that satisfy this

45
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,119
property

46
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,880
and i talked about this in the last

47
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,560
couple videos and kind of the cool thing

48
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,079
that we found was that

49
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,040
you look through the various different

50
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,280
contour lines of f and the maximum will

51
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,840
be achieved when that contour line is

52
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,920
just perfectly parallel to this contour

53
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,159
of g and you know a pretty classic

54
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,520
example for what you what these sorts of

55
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,920
things could mean or how it's used in

56
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,439
practice is if this was say a revenue

57
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,439
function for some kind of company you're

58
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,960
kind of modeling your revenues based on

59
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,640
different choices you could make running

60
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,640
that company and the constraint that

61
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,640
you'd have would be let's say a budget

62
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,200
so i'm just going to go ahead and write

63
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,719
budget or b for budget here

64
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,240
so you're trying to maximize revenues

65
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,759
and then you you have some sort of

66
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,040
dollar limit for what you're willing to

67
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,159
spend

68
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,520
and these of course are just kind of

69
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,200
made up functions you'd never have a

70
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,640
budget that looks like a circle and this

71
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,160
kind of random configuration for your

72
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,200
revenue but in principle you know what i

73
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,360
mean right

74
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,040
so the way that we took advantage of

75
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,640
this tangency property and i think this

76
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,560
is pretty clever let me just kind of

77
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
redraw it over here you're looking at

78
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,560
the point where the two functions are

79
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
just tangent to each other is that the

80
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,599
gradient

81
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,239
the gradient vector for the thing we're

82
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,040
maximizing which in this case is r

83
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,519
is going to be parallel or proportional

84
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,200
to the gradient vector of the constraint

85
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,440
which in this case is b

86
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,360
this can be proportional to the gradient

87
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,200
of the constraint

88
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
and what this means is that if we were

89
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,360
going to solve a set of equations what

90
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,879
you set up is you compute that gradient

91
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,400
of r and it'll involve you know two

92
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
different partial derivatives

93
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,360
and you set it equal not to the gradient

94
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,959
of b

95
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,239
because it's not necessarily equal to

96
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,159
the gradient of b

97
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,560
but it's proportional with some kind of

98
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,440
proportionality constant lambda now let

99
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,519
me it's kind of a squirrely lambda

100
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,640
lambda now that one doesn't look good

101
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,879
either does it

102
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,560
why are lambda so hard to draw all right

103
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,120
that looks fine so the gradient of the

104
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,440
revenue is proportional to the gradient

105
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,200
of the budget

106
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,040
and we did a couple examples of solving

107
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,640
this kind of thing this gives you two

108
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,879
separate equations from the two partial

109
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,879
derivatives and then you use this right

110
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,560
here this budget constraint as your

111
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,640
third equation

112
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,640
and the lagrangian the point of this

113
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,360
video this lagrangian function is

114
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,840
basically just a way to package up this

115
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,840
equation along with this equation into a

116
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,280
single entity so it's not really adding

117
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
new information and if you're solving

118
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,920
things by hand it doesn't really do

119
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,920
anything for you

120
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,920
but what makes it nice is that it's

121
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,599
something easier to hand a computer and

122
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,080
i'll show you what i mean so i'm going

123
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,519
to define the lagrangian itself which we

124
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,959
write with this kind of funky looking

125
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,920
script l

126
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,840
and it's a function with the same inputs

127
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,000
that your revenue function or the thing

128
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,159
that you're maximizing has along with

129
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,920
lambda along with that lagrange

130
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,760
multiplier

131
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
and the way that we define it

132
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,959
and i'm going to need some extra room so

133
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,120
i'm going to say it's equal to and kind

134
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,480
of define it down here the revenue

135
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,080
function

136
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,160
or whatever it is that you're maximizing

137
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,359
the function that you're maximizing

138
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,120
minus

139
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,040
lambda that lagrange multiplier so

140
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
that's just another input to this new

141
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,880
function that we're defining

142
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,520
multiplied by

143
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,000
the constraint function in this case b

144
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,479
evaluated at x y

145
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,160
minus whatever that constraint value is

146
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,120
in this case i put in 4 so you'd write

147
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,560
minus 4. if we wanted to be more general

148
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,560
maybe we would write

149
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
you know b for whatever your budget is

150
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
so over here you're subtracting off

151
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
little b

152
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,800
so this here is a new multivariable

153
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
function right it's something where you

154
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,880
could input x y and lambda and just kind

155
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,560
of plug it all in and you'd get some

156
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,400
kind of value and remember b in this

157
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,759
case is a is a constant so i'll go ahead

158
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,360
and write that

159
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,120
that

160
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,120
this right here is not considered a

161
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,680
variable this is just some constant your

162
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,440
variables are x y and lambda

163
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360
and this would seem like a totally weird

164
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,800
and random thing to do if you just saw

165
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
it out of context or if it was

166
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,320
unmotivated but what's kind of neat and

167
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
we'll go ahead and work through this

168
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,759
right now

169
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,680
is that when you take this

170
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,840
is it when you take the gradient

171
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,639
of this function called the lagrangian

172
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,639
and you set it equal to zero that's

173
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
going to encapsulate all three equations

174
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,840
that you need

175
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,160
and i'll show you what i mean by that so

176
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,520
let's let's just remember the gradient

177
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,440
of l

178
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,880
that that's a vector

179
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,720
that's got three different components

180
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,680
since l has three different inputs

181
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,680
you're going to have the partial

182
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,759
derivative of l

183
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,639
with respect to x

184
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,880
you're going to have the partial

185
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,960
derivative of l

186
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,199
with respect to y

187
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,720
and then finally the partial derivative

188
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,039
of l

189
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,560
with respect to lambda our lagrange

190
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,120
multiplier which we're considering an

191
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,639
input to this function

192
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,639
and remember whenever we write that a

193
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,400
vector equals zero really we mean the

194
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,080
zero vector often you'll see it in bold

195
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
if it's in a textbook but what we're

196
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,120
really saying is we set those three

197
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,680
different functions the three different

198
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,680
partial derivatives all equal to zero

199
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,800
so this is just a nice like closed form

200
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,880
compact way of saying set all of its

201
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,160
partial derivatives equal to zero

202
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,039
and let's go ahead and think about what

203
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
those partial derivatives actually are

204
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,840
so this first one the partial with

205
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,639
respect to x

206
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,240
partial derivative of the lagrangian

207
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,280
with respect to x

208
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,039
it's kind of fun you know you have all

209
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
these curly symbols the curly d the

210
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,960
curly l it makes it look like you're

211
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,720
doing some truly advanced math

212
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,080
but really it's just kind of artificial

213
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,280
fanciness right

214
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,880
but anyway so we take the partial

215
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,400
derivative with respect to x and what

216
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,919
that equals is

217
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,680
well it's whatever the partial

218
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,639
derivative of r

219
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,319
with respect to x is

220
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
minus and then lambda from x's

221
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,039
perspective lambda just looks like a

222
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,120
constant

223
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,599
so it's going to be lambda

224
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,199
and then this inside the parentheses the

225
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,240
partial derivative of that with respect

226
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,240
to x

227
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,759
well it's going to be

228
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,000
whatever the partial derivative of b is

229
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,000
with respect to x

230
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,919
but subtracting off that constant that

231
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,599
doesn't change the derivative so this

232
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,759
right here is the partial derivative of

233
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,160
lambda with respect to x

234
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,919
now if you set that equal to zero and i

235
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,520
know i've kind of run out of room on the

236
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
right here but if you set that equal to

237
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,240
zero

238
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,240
that's the same as just saying that the

239
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,080
partial derivative of r with respect to

240
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,599
x equals lambda times the partial

241
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,720
derivative of b with respect to x

242
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,120
and if you think about what's going to

243
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
happen when you unfold this property

244
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,520
that the gradient of r is proportional

245
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,879
to the gradient of b written up here

246
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
that's just the first portion of this

247
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,160
right if we're setting the gradients

248
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,000
equal then the first component of that

249
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,440
is to say that the partial derivative of

250
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
r

251
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,199
with respect to x is equal to lambda

252
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,639
times the partial derivative of b with

253
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,680
respect to x

254
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,759
and then if you do this for y if we take

255
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,120
the partial derivative of this

256
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,240
lagrangian

257
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,039
function

258
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,039
with respect to y

259
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,000
it's very similar right it's going to be

260
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,840
well you just take the partial

261
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,120
derivative of r with respect to y in

262
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,639
fact it all looks just identical

263
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
whatever r is you take its partial

264
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,840
derivative with respect to y and then we

265
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,319
subtract off lambda looks like a

266
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,080
constant as far as y is concerned

267
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,160
and then that's multiplied by well

268
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,840
what's the partial derivative of this

269
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,280
this term inside the parentheses with

270
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,120
respect to y well it's the partial of b

271
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,279
with respect to y

272
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,120
and again again if you imagine setting

273
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,880
that equal to zero

274
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,200
that's going to be the same as setting

275
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,880
this partial derivative term equal to

276
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,240
lambda times this partial derivative

277
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,600
term right you kind of just bring one to

278
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,839
the other side

279
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,720
so this second component of our

280
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,320
lagrangian equals zero equation

281
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,000
is just the second function that we've

282
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,360
seen and a lot of these examples that

283
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,120
we've been doing where you set one of

284
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,320
the gradient vectors proportional to the

285
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,320
other one

286
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,320
and the only real difference here

287
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,160
from stuff that we've seen already and

288
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,760
even then it's not that different is

289
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,200
that what happens when we take the

290
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,279
partial derivative

291
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,680
of this lagrangian

292
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,519
with respect to lambda with respect now

293
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,760
i'll go ahead and give it that kind of

294
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,600
green lambda color here well when we

295
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,959
take that partial derivative if we kind

296
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,560
of look up at the definition of the

297
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,040
function

298
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,800
r r never has a lambda in it right it's

299
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,959
purely a function of x and y so that

300
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,959
looks just like a constant when we're

301
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,040
differentiating with respect to lambda

302
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,240
so that's just going to be zero

303
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,560
when we take its partial derivative

304
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,120
and then this next component

305
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,720
b of x y minus b all of that just looks

306
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,480
like a constant as far as lambda is

307
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,480
concerned right there's x's there's y

308
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
there's this constant b but none of

309
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,160
these things have lambdas in them so

310
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
when we take the partial derivative with

311
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,720
respect to lambda this just looks like

312
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,080
some big constant times lambda itself

313
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,080
so what we're going to get is i guess

314
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,600
we're subtracting off right up here kind

315
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,480
of writing a minus sign we're

316
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,480
subtracting off

317
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,839
all the stuff that was in those

318
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,680
parentheses b

319
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,720
of x y

320
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,320
minus

321
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,920
b that constant

322
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
and this whole thing if we set that

323
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,440
whole thing equal to zero

324
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,440
well that's pretty much the same as

325
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,200
setting b of x y minus b equal to zero

326
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,480
and that that's really just the same as

327
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,760
saying hey

328
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,519
we're setting b

329
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,839
of x y

330
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,279
equal to that little b right setting

331
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,680
this partial derivative of the

332
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,800
lagrangian with respect to the lagrange

333
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,640
multiplier equal to zero boils down to

334
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,519
the constraint right the third equation

335
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,519
that we need to solve

336
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,760
so in that way

337
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,240
setting the gradient of this lagrangian

338
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,160
function equal to zero is just a very

339
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,680
compact way of packaging three separate

340
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,279
equations that we need to solve the

341
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,279
constraint optimization problem

342
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,680
and i'll emphasize that in practice if

343
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,200
you you know if you actually see

344
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,640
a function for

345
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,720
r for the thing that you're maximizing

346
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,320
and a function for the budget it's much

347
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,000
better i think to just directly think

348
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,000
about these parallel gradients and kind

349
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,440
of solve it from there because if you

350
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,880
construct the lagrangian and then

351
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,360
compute its gradient all you're really

352
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,880
doing is repackaging it up only to

353
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,200
un-package it again

354
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,360
but the point of this kind of the reason

355
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,519
that this is a very useful construct is

356
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,240
that computers often have really fast

357
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,240
ways of solving things like this things

358
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,160
like the gradient of some function

359
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
equals zero

360
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,920
and the reason is because that's how you

361
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,200
solve unconstrained maximization

362
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
problems right

363
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,040
this is very similar to as if we just

364
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,440
looked at this function l out of context

365
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,120
and we're asked hey what is its maximum

366
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,279
value what are the critical points that

367
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,720
it has and you set its gradient equal to

368
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,079
zero

369
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,760
so kind of the whole point of this

370
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,519
lagrangian is that it turns our

371
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,000
constrained optimization problem

372
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,639
involving r and b and this new made-up

373
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,720
variable lambda into an unconstrained

374
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,880
optimization problem where we're just

375
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,279
setting the gradient of some function

376
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,959
equal to zero so computers can often do

377
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,720
that really quickly so if you just hand

378
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,720
the computer this function it will be

379
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,240
able to find you an answer whereas you

380
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
know it's harder to say hey computer i

381
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
want you to think about when the

382
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,720
gradients are parallel and also consider

383
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,639
this constraint function

384
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,560
it's just kind of a cleaner way to

385
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,839
package it all up

386
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,279
so with that i'll see you next video

387
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,360
where i'm going to talk about the

388
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,120
significance of this lambda term how

389
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
it's not just a ghost variable but

390
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,040
actually has a pretty nice

391
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,440
interpretation for a given constraint

392
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
problem
