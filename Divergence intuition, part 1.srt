1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,524
- [Voiceover] Alright everyone.

2
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:03,259
We've gotten to one of
my all-time favorite

3
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:06,267
multi-variable calculus
topics, divergence.

4
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:08,376
In the next few videos I'm gonna describe

5
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:10,502
what it is mathematically
and how you compute it

6
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:12,504
and all of that but
here I just want to give

7
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:15,000
a very visual understanding of what it is

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,380
that it's trying to represent.

9
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,782
So I've got a picture in
front of us, a vector field.

10
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:22,516
I've said before that a pretty neat way

11
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:24,499
to understand vector
fields is to think of them

12
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:26,406
as representing a fluid flow.

13
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:28,398
What I mean by that is you can think of

14
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:31,174
every single point in space as a particle,

15
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:33,559
maybe an air particle or a water particle.

16
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:35,947
Something to that effect.

17
00:00:35,947 --> 00:00:37,751
Since what a vector field does

18
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:39,775
is it associates each point in space

19
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:41,646
with some kind of vector

20
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:43,932
and remember I mean, whenever
we represent vector fields,

21
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:46,381
we only show a small subset
of all of those vectors,

22
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,763
but in principle you should be thinking of

23
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:51,290
every one of those infinitely
many points in space

24
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,671
being associated with
one of these vectors.

25
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:56,003
The fact that they're
kind of smoothly changing

26
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:57,607
as you traverse across space

27
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:00,793
,means that showing this
very small finite subsample

28
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,675
of those infinitely many vectors

29
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:04,998
still gives a pretty good
feel for what's going on.

30
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,002
So if we have these fluid particles

31
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:09,874
and you have a vector
assigned to each one,

32
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:12,257
kind of a natural thought
you might have is to say

33
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:15,096
what would happen if you let
things progress over time

34
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:18,702
where at any given instant
the velocity of one of

35
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:21,822
these particles is given by
that vector connected to it.

36
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:24,040
As it moves it will be
touching a different vector.

37
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,436
So it's velocity might turn.

38
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:26,983
It might go in a different direction.

39
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:29,243
For each one it will kind
of traverse some path

40
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:32,243
as determined by the vectors
that it's touching as it goes

41
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:34,537
and when you think of all
of them doing this at once,

42
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:37,503
it will feel like a certain fluid flow.

43
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:39,409
For this you don't
actually have to imagine.

44
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,227
I went ahead and put together
an animation for you.

45
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,762
So we'll put some water molecules or dots

46
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:47,130
to represent a small sample
of the water molecules

47
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,765
throughout space here and then
I'm just gonna let it play

48
00:01:49,765 --> 00:01:54,248
where each one moves along the
vector that it's closest to.

49
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,496
I'll just let it play forward here

50
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:58,923
where each one is flowing along the vector

51
00:01:58,923 --> 00:02:02,012
that's touching the point
where it is in that moment.

52
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:07,289
So for example, if we were to go back

53
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:09,668
and maybe focus our
attention on just one vector

54
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:12,252
like this guy, one particle, excuse me,

55
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,291
he's attached to this
vector so he'll be moving

56
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,006
in that direction but just for an instant

57
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:17,252
because after he moves a little

58
00:02:17,252 --> 00:02:18,873
he'll be attached to a different vector.

59
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:22,991
So if you kind of let it play
and follow that particular dot

60
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:26,533
after a little bit you'll
find him elsewhere.

61
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,419
I think this is the one, right.

62
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,248
Now he's gonna be moving along this vector

63
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:32,769
or whatever one is really attached to him.

64
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,510
Thinking about all of the
particles all at once doing this

65
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,761
gives a sort of global
view of the vector field.

66
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,841
If you're studying math,
you might start to ask

67
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,991
some natural questions about
the nature of that fluid flow.

68
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:46,559
For example, you might
wonder if you were to just

69
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:49,044
look in a certain region
and count the number

70
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,323
of water molecules that
are inside that region,

71
00:02:51,323 --> 00:02:53,534
does that count of yours change

72
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:56,254
as you play this animation,

73
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:58,282
as you let this flow over time?

74
00:02:58,282 --> 00:02:59,989
In this particular example you can look

75
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,228
and it doesn't look
like the count changes.

76
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:03,273
Certainly not that much.

77
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:06,248
It's not increasing over
time or decreasing over time

78
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:08,183
In a little bit, if I
gave you the function

79
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:09,751
that determines this vector field,

80
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:12,034
you will be able to tell
me why it's the case

81
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:14,383
that the number of
molecules in that region

82
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:15,993
doesn't tend to change

83
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,892
but if you were to look
at another example,

84
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:20,983
like a guy that looks like this

85
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,510
and if I were to say I want you to focus

86
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,474
on what happens around the origin,

87
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:26,219
in that little region around the origin,

88
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,269
you can probably predict
how once I start playing it,

89
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,245
once I put some water molecules in there

90
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,264
and let them flow along the
vectors that they flow along,

91
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:38,510
the density inside that region
around the origin decreases.

92
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,035
So we put a whole bunch of vectors there

93
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:41,257
and I'll just play it for a quick instant.

94
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,742
Just kind of let it jump for an instant.

95
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:46,264
One thing that characterizes
this field around the origin

96
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:48,520
is that decrease in density.

97
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,264
What you might say if you
wanted to be suggestive

98
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,410
of the operation that I'm leading to here

99
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,505
is that the water
molecules tend to diverge

100
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,001
away from the origin.

101
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:59,325
So the kind of divergence
of the vector field

102
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:01,338
near that origin is positive.

103
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:03,077
You'll see what I mean
mathematically by that

104
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,745
in the next couple videos,

105
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,954
but if we were to flip
over these vectors, right,

106
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:08,282
if we were to flip them around,

107
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,250
now if I were to ask about the density

108
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,188
in that same region around the origin,

109
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:14,159
we can probably see how
it's gonna increase.

110
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,247
When I play that fluid flow
over just a short spurt of time,

111
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:20,763
the density in the region increases.

112
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:23,243
So these don't diverge away, they converge

113
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:26,012
towards the origin.

114
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:28,769
That fact actually has some
mathematical significance

115
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,503
for the function representing
this vector field

116
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:33,036
around that point.

117
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:35,220
Even if the vector field
doesn't represent fluid flow,

118
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,846
if it represents a magnetic field

119
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:40,886
or an electric field or things like that,

120
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:43,352
there's a certain meaning to this idea

121
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:46,262
of diverging away from a point
or converging to a point.

122
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:49,267
Another way that people
sometimes think about this,

123
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:50,739
if you look at that same kind of

124
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:53,258
outward-flowing vector field

125
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:55,512
as rather than thinking
of a decrease in density,

126
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,763
imagining that the fluid
would have to constantly

127
00:04:57,763 --> 00:04:59,834
be repopulated around that point.

128
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,285
So you're really thinking of
the origin as a source of fluid

129
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:03,920
and if I had animated this better,

130
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,004
a whole bunch of other points
should be sources of fluid

131
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,085
so that the density doesn't
decrease everywhere,

132
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:11,136
but the idea is that points
of positive divergence

133
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:12,994
where things are diverging away

134
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:15,068
would have to have a source of that fluid

135
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:17,154
in order to kind of
keep things sustaining.

136
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:19,928
Conversely, if you were to look
at that kind of inward flow

137
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:23,249
or what you might call
negative divergence example

138
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:25,763
and you were to play it but
it were to go continuously,

139
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:27,740
you'd have to think of
that center point as a sink

140
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,930
where all the fluid kind
of just sort of flows away.

141
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,459
That's actually a technical term.

142
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,305
People will say the
vector field has a sink

143
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:36,366
at such and such point or
the electromagnetic field

144
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:37,756
has a sink at such and such point

145
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:40,451
and that often has a certain significance.

146
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:43,767
If we go back to that
original example here

147
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:46,517
where there is no change
in fluid density, right,

148
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:48,756
what you might notice,
this feels a lot more like

149
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:50,497
actual water than the other ones

150
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:53,128
because there is no
change in density there.

151
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:55,267
If you can find a way to
mathematically describe

152
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:58,500
that lack of a change in density,

153
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,159
it's a pretty good way
to model water flow.

154
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:03,005
Again, even if it's not water flow

155
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:04,874
but it's something like
the electromagnetic field,

156
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:06,475
there's often a significance to this

157
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:09,005
no changing in density idea.

158
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:10,952
So with that I think
I've jabbered on enough

159
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:12,928
about the visuals of it
and in the next video

160
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:15,552
I'll tell you what
divergence is mathematically,

161
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:17,899
how you compute it, go
through a couple examples,

162
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:18,848
things like that.

163
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:19,760
See you next video.
