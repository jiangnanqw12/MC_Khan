1
00:00:00,665 --> 00:00:02,331
- [Voiceover] So, in the last video,

2
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:04,038
I introduced the vector form of

3
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,745
the multivariable chain rule

4
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:07,045
and just to remind ourselves,

5
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:09,361
I'm saying you have
some kind of function f,

6
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:10,661
and in this case I said it comes from

7
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:13,831
a 100 dimensional space,
so you might imagine--

8
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:16,066
Well, I can't imagine a
100 dimensional space,

9
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,397
but in principle, you're just thinking

10
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:20,437
of some area that's 100 dimensions,

11
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,810
it can be two if you wanted to think

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,557
more concretely in two dimensions.

13
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,751
And it's a scalar valued function

14
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:28,027
so it just outputs to a number line,

15
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,733
some kind of number line that I'll think

16
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:31,566
of as f as its output.

17
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,608
And what we're gonna do is we compose it

18
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:36,990
with a vector valued function

19
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,087
so some function that
takes in a single number t

20
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:43,279
and then outputs into that
super high dimensional space.

21
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,839
So you're thinking, you go
from the single variable t

22
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:47,952
to some very high dimensional space

23
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:49,944
that we think of as full of vectors,

24
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:53,750
and then you take from that
over to a single variable,

25
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,908
over to a number.

26
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:57,452
And you know, the way you'd write that out

27
00:00:57,452 --> 00:01:00,581
is you'd say f composed
with the output of v,

28
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:02,748
so f composed with v of t,

29
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:07,570
and what we're interested in
doing is taking its derivative.

30
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,715
So the derivative of that composition is--

31
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:13,788
and I told you and we
kind of walked through

32
00:01:13,788 --> 00:01:16,591
where this come from, the gradient of f,

33
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:20,758
evaluated at v of t, evaluated
at your original output,

34
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:24,872
that product, with the derivative of v,

35
00:01:24,872 --> 00:01:27,963
the vectorized derivative,
and what that means, you know,

36
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,202
for v, you're just taking the
derivative of every component.

37
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:33,722
So when you take this and
you take the derivative

38
00:01:33,722 --> 00:01:37,054
with respect to t, all that means is

39
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:40,955
that each component, you're
taking the derivative of it.

40
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:44,246
The x1 dt, the x2 dt, on and on until d

41
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:47,579
and then the one hundredth component dt.

42
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,007
So this was the vectorized form

43
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:54,649
of the multivariable chain rule.

44
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,315
And what I wanna do here is show

45
00:01:56,315 --> 00:02:00,541
how this looks a lot like
a directional derivative.

46
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,800
And if you haven't watched the video

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,995
on the directional derivative,
maybe go back, take a look,

48
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,392
kind of remind yourself, but in principle,

49
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,668
you say, if you're in
the input space of f,

50
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:13,260
and you nudge yourself
along some kind of vector v,

51
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,722
and maybe just because I'm using v there,

52
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:17,567
I'll instead say some kind of vector w.

53
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,273
So not a function, just a vector.

54
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,508
And you're wondering, hey,
how much does that result

55
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,149
in a change to the output of f,

56
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:26,100
that's answered by the
directional derivative

57
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,985
and you'd write directional derivative

58
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:32,033
in the direction of w of f,

59
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,821
the directional derivative of f,

60
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,584
and I should say at some
point, some input point,

61
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:38,981
p for that input point and
it's a vector in this case,

62
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:41,544
like a 100 dimensional vector.

63
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,077
And the way you evaluate it,

64
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:45,556
is you take the gradient of f,

65
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:48,278
this is why we use the nabla
notation in the first place,

66
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:50,229
it's an indicative of how we compute it,

67
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:53,967
the gradient of f evaluated
at that same input point,

68
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,836
the same input vector p.

69
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:58,374
So here, just to be clear,
you'd be thinking of

70
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:02,370
whatever vector to your
input point, that's p.

71
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,873
But then the nudge, the nudge away

72
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:06,515
from that input point is w.

73
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:08,587
And you take the dot product

74
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:11,800
between that and the vector itself,

75
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,917
the vector that represents
your nudge direction.

76
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:15,771
But that looks a lot like

77
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:17,518
the multivariable chain rule up here,

78
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:20,647
except instead of w, you're
taking the derivative,

79
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,679
the vector value derivative of v,

80
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,466
so this whole thing you could say

81
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:27,480
is the directional derivative
in the direction of

82
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,406
the derivative of t, and
that's kind of confusing.

83
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:34,585
Directional derivative in the
direction of a derivative,

84
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:38,790
of f, and what point are you taking this,

85
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,223
at what point are you taking
this directional derivative?

86
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:44,636
Well, it's wherever the output of v is.

87
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:47,608
So this is very compact,
it's saying quite a bit here.

88
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:49,910
But a way that you could
be thinking about this,

89
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,493
is v of t, so I'm gonna
kind of erase here.

90
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,584
V of t has you zooming all about

91
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:03,473
and as you shift t, it kind of moves you

92
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:05,708
through this space in some way.

93
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,333
And each one of these output points here

94
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:11,000
represents the vector,
v of t at some point,

95
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:16,517
the derivative of that, what
does this derivative represent?

96
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,874
That's the tangent vector to that motion,

97
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:21,202
you know, so you're zipping
about through that space,

98
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:22,644
the tangent vector to your motion,

99
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:25,727
that's how we interpret v prime of t,

100
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:32,787
the derivative of v with respect to t.

101
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,225
I mean why should that make sense?

102
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:36,135
Why should the directional derivative

103
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:38,451
in the direction of v prime of t,

104
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:41,865
this change to the
intermediary function v,

105
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,115
have anything to do with the
multivariable chain rule?

106
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:46,985
Well, remember what
we're asking when we say

107
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:50,308
dt of this composition is we're saying

108
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:54,177
we take a tiny nudge to t,
so that tiny change here,

109
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:56,313
in the value t, and we're wondering

110
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:59,401
what changed that result
in after the composition?

111
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:02,490
Well, at a given point,
that tiny nudge in t

112
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,187
causes a change in the
direction of v prime of t.

113
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:07,284
That's kind of the whole meaning

114
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:08,991
of this vector value derivative.

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,957
You change t by a little bit,
and that's gonna tell you

116
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:14,274
how you move in the output space.

117
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:16,346
But then you say, "Okay,
so I've moved a little bit

118
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:18,621
"in this intermediary
100 dimensional space,

119
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:21,263
"how does that influence the output of f

120
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:22,685
"based on the behavior of just

121
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,432
"the multivariable function f?"

122
00:05:24,432 --> 00:05:27,317
Well, that's what the
directional derivative is asking.

123
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:30,324
It says you take a nudge in
the direction of some vector,

124
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:32,641
in this case, I wrote
v prime of t over here.

125
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:34,826
More generally, you
could say any vector w,

126
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:36,492
you take a nudge in that direction.

127
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:38,077
And more importantly, you know,

128
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:40,271
the size of v prime of t matters here.

129
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:42,059
If you're moving really
quickly, you would expect

130
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:44,009
that change to be larger, so the fact

131
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,473
that v prime of t would
be larger is helpful.

132
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,405
And the directional
derivative is telling you

133
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:52,575
the size of the change in f as a ratio

134
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:56,557
of the proportion of
that directional vector

135
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,385
that you went along. Right?

136
00:05:58,385 --> 00:06:00,661
You could--another notation
for the directional derivative

137
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,755
is to say partial f, and then partial

138
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:05,732
whatever that vector is.

139
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,007
Basically saying you
take size of that nudge

140
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:11,636
along that vector as a
proportion of the vector itself,

141
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:13,960
and then you consider
the change to the output

142
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,376
and you're taking the ratio.

143
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,530
So I think this is a very
beautiful way of understanding

144
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,050
the multivariable chain rule.

145
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,756
Cause it give this image of, you know,

146
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,260
you're thinking of v of
t, and you're thinking

147
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,722
of zipping along in some way,

148
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:26,917
and the direction and
value of your velocity

149
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,948
as you zip along is what determines

150
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:31,590
the change in the output
of the function f.

151
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,459
So hopefully, that helps
give a better understanding

152
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,247
both of the directional derivative

153
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,319
and of the multivariable chain rule.

154
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,540
It's one of those nice
little interpretations.
