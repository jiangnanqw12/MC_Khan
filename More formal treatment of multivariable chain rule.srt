00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:02,793
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,793 --> 00:00:04,881
So this is what I might
call a more optional video.

3
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:06,891
In the last couple videos, I talked about

4
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:08,601
this multivariable chain rule,

5
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:10,805
and I give some justification.

6
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:11,779
And it might have been considered

7
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,477
a little bit hand-wavy by some.

8
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:14,768
I was doing a lot of things

9
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:17,040
that looked kind of
like taking a derivative

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,430
with respect to t, and
then multiplying that

11
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,193
by an infinitesimal quantity, dt,

12
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:23,092
and thinking of canceling those out.

13
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:24,705
And some people might say, "Ah!

14
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:25,755
"But this isn't really a fraction.

15
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:28,152
"That's a derivative, that's
a differential operator,

16
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:29,931
"and you're treating it incorrectly."

17
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:31,740
And while that's true,

18
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,781
the intuitions underlying a lot of this

19
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:35,710
actually matches with the
formal argument pretty well.

20
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,572
So what I wanna do here is just talk about

21
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:40,155
what the formal argument behind

22
00:00:41,806 --> 00:00:42,937
the multivariable chain rule is,

23
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:46,345
and just to remind ourselves
of the setup of where we are.

24
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:48,515
You're thinking of v as
a vector-valued function,

25
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,377
so this is something that
takes as an input, t,

26
00:00:51,377 --> 00:00:52,774
that lives on a number line,

27
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:56,941
and then v maps this to some
kind of high-dimensional space.

28
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,697
In the simplest case, you
might just think of that

29
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:01,860
as a two-dimensional space,

30
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,012
maybe it's three-dimensional space.

31
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:05,454
Or it could be 100-dimensional.

32
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:06,917
You don't have to literally
be visualizing it.

33
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:09,381
And then f, our function f,

34
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:11,621
somehow takes that 100-dimensional space,

35
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:13,333
or two-dimensional, or three-dimensional,

36
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,584
whatever it is,

37
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:16,665
and then maps it onto the number line.

38
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:19,264
So the overall effect of
the composition function

39
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:21,884
is to just take a real
number to a real number

40
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:23,164
so it's a single-variable function.

41
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:25,616
So that's where we're taking
this ordinary derivative,

42
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:27,754
rather than a partial
derivative, or gradient,

43
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,236
or anything like that.

44
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:31,374
But because it goes through
a multi-dimensional space,

45
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:34,337
and you have this intermediary,
multivariable nature to it,

46
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:36,014
that's why you have a gradient,

47
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:37,221
and a vector-value derivative.

48
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:39,339
With the formal argument,
the first thing you might do

49
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:42,890
is just write out the formal
definition of a derivative.

50
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,580
And in this case,

51
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,893
it's a limit.

52
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:48,145
Definitions of derivatives
are always gonna be

53
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:50,577
some kind of limit as a
variable goes to zero.

54
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,831
And here, you're loosely
thinking about h as being dt.

55
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,270
And you could write delta t,

56
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,350
but it's common to use h
just because that can be used

57
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,919
for whatever your
differential quantity is.

58
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,527
So that's on the denominator,

59
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:02,725
'cause you're thinking of it as dt.

60
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:05,774
And the top is whatever the change

61
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:07,347
to this whole function is

62
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:09,770
when you nudge that input by t.

63
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,631
And what I mean by that
is you'll take f of v,

64
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:16,131
not of t, but of t plus h,

65
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:18,545
that kind of nudged output value,

66
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:20,826
and you're wondering how different that is

67
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:24,576
from f of v of t, the
original value, v of t.

68
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:28,656
So this is what happens
when you just apply

69
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,485
the formal definition of the derivative,

70
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:34,529
the ordinary derivative, to
your composition function.

71
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,188
And now, what do you do

72
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:38,816
as you're trying to reason
about what this should equal?

73
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:40,003
And a good place to start, actually,

74
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:41,957
is to look back to the
intuition that I was giving

75
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:44,187
for the multivariable chain
rule in the first place.

76
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:47,376
You imagine nudging your input by some dt,

77
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,235
some tiny change, and I was saying,

78
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,443
oh, so that causes a change

79
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:53,128
in the intermediary space

80
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:55,295
of some kind of, you know,

81
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:58,479
you could call it dv,
a change in the vector.

82
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,356
And the way that you're thinking that,

83
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:00,873
that as you take the
vector value derivative

84
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:05,136
and multiply it by dt, it's
the proportionality constant

85
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:07,866
between the size of your nudge
and the resulting vector.

86
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:10,689
And loosely, you might imagine
those dt's crossing out

87
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,146
as if they were fractions.

88
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:13,379
It doesn't really matter.

89
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,899
And then you say, "What does this change?"

90
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:17,506
This change by a dv cause for f,

91
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:20,662
and by definition, the resulting nudge

92
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:23,030
to the output space of f

93
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,525
is the directional
derivative in the direction

94
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:29,211
of whatever your vector
nudge is of the function f.

95
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:30,794
So this is the loose intuition,

96
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,162
and where does that
carry over to formality?

97
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:36,093
You say, "Well, in this
intermediary space,

98
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:38,304
"we have to deal with the
vector value derivative of v."

99
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:39,873
So it might be a good thing to just

100
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:41,878
write down that definition, right?

101
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:42,900
Write down the fact

102
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,369
that the definition for the
vector value derivative of v,

103
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:48,910
again, it looks almost identical.

104
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,304
All these derivative definitions

105
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:52,704
really do look kind of the same

106
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,243
'cause what you're doing
is you're taking the limit

107
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:57,852
as h goes to zero,

108
00:03:57,852 --> 00:04:00,974
h we're still thinking of as being dt.

109
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,298
So that kind of sits on the bottom.

110
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:05,095
But here you're just wondering
how your vector changes.

111
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:07,561
And the difference, even though
we're kind of writing this

112
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,867
the same way, and it looks
almost identical notationally,

113
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:14,204
what's on the numerator
here, this v of t plus h,

114
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:16,568
and this v of t, these are vectors.

115
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:18,509
So this is kind of a
vector minus a vector.

116
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,554
When you take the limit,

117
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:21,159
you're getting a limiting vector,

118
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:22,899
something in your high-dimensional space.

119
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,229
It's not just a number.

120
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:25,878
And now, another way to write this,

121
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:27,571
one that's more helpful,

122
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,271
more conducive to manipulation,

123
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:32,080
is to say not that it equals
the limit of this value,

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,479
and I'm gonna go ahead and
just copy this value here,

125
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,810
kind of down here, and say,

126
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,176
the value of our derivative

127
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:43,509
actually equals this, subject
to some kind of error,

128
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:45,527
which I'll just write as E of h,

129
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:47,830
like an error function of h.

130
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,894
And what you should be thinking is that

131
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:51,877
that error function goes
to zero as h goes to zero.

132
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:53,641
This is just writing
things so that we're able

133
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:55,858
to manipulate it a little bit more easily.

134
00:04:55,858 --> 00:04:58,669
So I'll give ourselves some room here.

135
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,324
And what you can do with this

136
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:02,211
is multiply all sides by h.

137
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:05,720
So this is our vector value derivative,

138
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,220
just rewriting it.

139
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:10,381
Multiply it by h.

140
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:11,929
And you're thinking of this h as a dt,

141
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,021
so maybe in the back of your mind,

142
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,207
you're kind of thinking of
canceling this dt with the h.

143
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:18,736
And what it equals is this
top, this numerator here,

144
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,653
which was v of t plus h

145
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,490
minus v of t.

146
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:27,355
And in the back of your mind,

147
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:30,710
you might be thinking,
this whole thing represents

148
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,856
dv, a change in v.

149
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:35,126
So the idea of canceling
out that dt with the h

150
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,456
really does kind of come through here.

151
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:37,904
But the difference between the more

152
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,874
hand-waving argument before
of canceling those out

153
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:41,341
and what we're doing here

154
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,693
is now we're accounting
for that error function.

155
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:47,214
In this case it's now multiplied by h

156
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:51,007
'cause everything was
multiplied by h error function.

157
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:53,857
And there's actually another
way that I'm gonna write this.

158
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,981
There's a very useful
convention in analysis

159
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,751
where I'll take something like this

160
00:05:58,751 --> 00:05:59,739
and instead I'll write it

161
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,156
as little o of h.

162
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:04,189
And this isn't literally a function.

163
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:06,544
It's just a stand-in to
say whatever this is,

164
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:07,832
whatever function that represents,

165
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:11,884
it satisfies the property that
when we take that function

166
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:13,540
and divide it by h,

167
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,367
that will go to zero as
h goes to zero, right?

168
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,842
Which is true here because
you imagine taking this

169
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:20,597
and dividing by h, and that would be,

170
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:23,154
this h cancels out and you
just have your error function

171
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:24,205
is gonna go to zero.

172
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,663
So now what I do is I use
this entire expression

173
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:29,996
to write this v of t plus h.

174
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:32,110
And the reason I wanna do that

175
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,886
if we kind of scroll back up

176
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:36,700
is because we see v of t plus h showing up

177
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,739
in the original definition we care about.

178
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:42,051
So this is just a way of
starting to get a grapple on that

179
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:44,778
a little bit more firmly.

180
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:48,945
So what I'd write, I'd say
that that v of t plus h,

181
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:53,172
v of t plus h, that nudged output value,

182
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:56,823
is equal to the original
value that I have, v of t

183
00:06:56,823 --> 00:07:00,257
plus, and it's gonna be
plus this derivative term,

184
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:01,966
and you can kind of think that it's almost

185
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:04,218
like a Taylor polynomial,

186
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:06,497
where this is our first order term.

187
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:08,854
We're evaluating it at whatever that t is,

188
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:11,229
but we're multiplying it
by the value of that nudge,

189
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:12,370
that linear term.

190
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,930
And then the rest of the stuff
is just some little o of h.

191
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,564
And maybe you'd say,
"Shouldn't you be subtracting

192
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,602
"off that little o of h?"

193
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:20,869
And it's not an actual function.

194
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:22,749
It just represents anything that shrinks.

195
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:25,215
And maybe I should say
it's the absolute value,

196
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:27,485
like the magnitude, 'cause in this case,

197
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:29,324
this is a vector-valued quantity.

198
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,739
You know, that error is a vector.

199
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:33,056
So it's the size of that vector

200
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:36,223
divided by the size of h goes to zero.

201
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:39,313
So this is the main tool that
we're gonna end up using.

202
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:41,646
This is the way to represent

203
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:44,366
v of t plus h.

204
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:47,065
And now if we go back up
to the original definition

205
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,714
of the vector value derivative,

206
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:52,025
and I'll go ahead and copy that,

207
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:54,275
go ahead and copy that guy.

208
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,620
Little bit of debris.

209
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:06,150
So copy that original definition

210
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,045
for the ordinary derivative
of the composition function,

211
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:11,650
and now when I write things in according

212
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,307
to all the manipulations that we just did,

213
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:17,320
this is really, it's still a limit,

214
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,153
'cause h goes to zero,

215
00:08:20,137 --> 00:08:22,892
but what we put on the inside here

216
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:23,975
is it's f of,

217
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:27,443
now instead of writing v of t plus h,

218
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:29,596
I'm gonna use everything
that I did up there.

219
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:32,064
It's the value of v of t

220
00:08:32,064 --> 00:08:33,647
plus the derivative

221
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:39,473
at our point times the size of h.

222
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:40,970
So again, it's kind of
like a Taylor polynomial.

223
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,390
This is your linear term,

224
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,613
and then it's plus something
that we don't care about,

225
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:46,145
something that's gonna get really small

226
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:47,151
as h goes small,

227
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,995
and really small in comparison
to h, more importantly.

228
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,292
And from that you subtract off

229
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:53,292
f of v of t.

230
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:57,650
Kind of running off the edge.

231
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,159
I always keep running off the edge.

232
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,360
And all of that is divided by h.

233
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,752
Now, the point here is

234
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,801
when you look at this limit,
because we're taking it

235
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,366
as h goes to zero,

236
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:10,987
we'll basically be able to
ignore this o of h component

237
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:12,451
because as h goes to zero,

238
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,793
this gets very, very
small in comparison to h.

239
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:17,969
So everything that's on the inside here

240
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,246
is basically just the v of t

241
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:22,746
plus this vector value, right?

242
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,887
And this is h times some kind of vector.

243
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:28,288
But if you think back, I made a video

244
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:31,576
on the formal definition of
the directional derivative.

245
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,013
And if you remembered,
or if you kind of go back

246
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:36,658
and take a look now, this is
exactly the formal definition

247
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:38,284
of the directional derivative.

248
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:40,076
We're taking h to go to zero,

249
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:41,808
the thing we're multiplying it by

250
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:43,252
is a certain vector quantity.

251
00:09:43,252 --> 00:09:46,994
That vector is the nudge
to your original value,

252
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:49,276
and then we're dividing everything by h.

253
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:51,266
So by definition, this entire thing

254
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:55,276
is the directional derivative
in the direction of

255
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:58,345
the derivative of the function of t.

256
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:00,382
I'm writing v prime t
instead of getting the whole

257
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:01,882
dv, dt down there.

258
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,274
All of that of f evaluated at where?

259
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:06,395
Well, the place that we're starting

260
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:09,145
is just v of t, so that's v of t.

261
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:14,332
And that's it, that's the answer.

262
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:16,266
'Cause when you evaluate
the directional derivative,

263
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:19,943
the way that you do that,
you take the gradient of f,

264
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:22,321
evaluate it at whatever
point you're starting at,

265
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,099
in this case it's the output of v of t,

266
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,223
and you take the dot product between that

267
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:30,178
and the vector value derivative.

268
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:31,447
Well, I mean (chuckles),

269
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:33,508
the dot product between that
and whatever your vector is,

270
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,258
which, in this case, is
the vector-value derivative

271
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:38,455
of v, and that's the
multivariable chain rule.

272
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:41,453
And if you look back through
the line of reasoning,

273
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:43,200
it all really did match

274
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,241
the thoughts of kind of nudging, nudging,

275
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,851
and seeing how that nudged, right?

276
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:49,808
Because the reason we thought to use

277
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:50,891
the vector-value derivative

278
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,688
was because of that intuition.

279
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:54,809
And the reason for all the
manipulation that I did

280
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:59,022
is just because I wanted
to be able to express

281
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:01,579
what a nudge to the input of v looks like.

282
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,112
And what that looks like
is the original value

283
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:05,758
plus a certain vector here.

284
00:11:05,758 --> 00:11:08,431
This was the resulting nudge
in the intermediary space.

285
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,098
I wanted to express that in a formal way.

286
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:12,151
And sure, we have this kind of o of h term

287
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:15,685
that expresses something
that shrinks really fast,

288
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:17,531
but once you express it like that,

289
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:20,656
you just end up plopping out

290
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:23,928
the definition of the
directional derivative.

291
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:26,621
So I hope that gives kind
of a satisfying reason

292
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:29,811
for those of you who are a
little bit more rigor-inclined

293
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:32,593
for why the multivariable
chain rule works.

294
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,071
I should also maybe mention
there's a more general

295
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:37,358
multivariable chain rule
for vector-valued functions.

296
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:38,560
I'll get to that at another point

297
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,056
when I talk about the connections

298
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:43,139
between multivariable
calculus and linear algebra.

299
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,008
But for now, that's pretty
much all you need to know

300
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:48,256
on the multivariable chain rule

301
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:50,710
when the ultimate composition is,

302
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,192
you know, just a real
number to a real number.

303
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,706
And I'll see you next video.
