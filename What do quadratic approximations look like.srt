1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:02,261
- [Voiceover] In the last
couple videos I talked about

2
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:04,354
the local linearization of a function.

3
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:07,096
And in terms of graphs, there's
a nice interpretation here

4
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:09,023
where if you imagine a graph of a function

5
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:11,246
and you want to approximate
it near a specific point,

6
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:13,706
you picture that point
somewhere on the graph,

7
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:14,986
and it doesn't have to be there,

8
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:18,263
you know I can choose to be
anywhere else along the graph,

9
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:20,175
but if you have some sort
of point and you want

10
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,063
to approximate the function near there

11
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,169
you can have another function whose graph

12
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:25,913
is just a flat plane,

13
00:00:25,913 --> 00:00:27,839
and specifically a plane
which is tangent to

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,865
your original graph at that point.

15
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:31,496
And that's kind of visually how you

16
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:33,311
think about the local linearization.

17
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:35,152
And what I'm going to
start doing here in this

18
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:36,898
next video and in the ones following,

19
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:39,470
is talking about quadratic approximations.

20
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,303
So quadratic approximations,

21
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:49,010
and these, these basically
take these to the next level.

22
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,508
And first I'll show what
they look like graphically

23
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:53,444
and then I'll show you what
it actually means in formulas.

24
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:55,990
But graphically instead of
having a plane that's flat,

25
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,762
you have a few more
parameters to deal with,

26
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:00,321
and you can give yourself
some kind of surface that

27
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,726
hugs the graph a little bit more closely.

28
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:04,568
It's still going to be
simpler in terms of formulas,

29
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:07,240
it can still be notably simpler
than the original function,

30
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,282
but this actually hugs it closely.

31
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:11,178
And as we move around the point

32
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:12,598
that it's approximating here,

33
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:14,890
the way that it hugs it
can look pretty different.

34
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,605
And if you want to
think graphically what a

35
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:19,489
quadratic approximation is,

36
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:22,414
you can basically say if
you slice this surface,

37
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:25,185
this kind of ghostly white
surface in any direction

38
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,027
it'll look like a parabola of some kind.

39
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:29,702
And notice that given that
we're dealing in multiple

40
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:32,431
dimensions that can make
things look pretty complicated,

41
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:35,271
like this right here, you know
if you slice it kind of in

42
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:39,420
this direction, whoa, if you
look at it from this angle

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,881
it kind of looks like
a concave up parabola,

44
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,330
but if you were looking at it from another

45
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,453
direction it kind of looks concave down,

46
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:46,903
and all-in-all you get
a surface that actually

47
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:49,364
has quite a bit of
information carried within it.

48
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:52,752
And you can see that by
hugging the graph very closely

49
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:55,185
this approximation is going to be,

50
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:56,788
well, it's going to be even closer,

51
00:01:56,788 --> 00:01:59,038
because near the point
where you're approximating

52
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,262
you can go out, you know,

53
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:01,767
you can take a couple steps away

54
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,071
and the approximation is still going to

55
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:04,702
be very close to what the graph is,

56
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:06,249
and it's only when you
step really far away from

57
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:08,431
the original point that the approximation

58
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:11,059
starts to deviate away
from the graph itself.

59
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:12,662
So this is going to be
something that although

60
00:02:12,662 --> 00:02:14,237
it takes more information to describe than

61
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:15,842
a local linearization it gives

62
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:17,824
us a much closer approximation.

63
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:19,764
So a linear function which, you know,

64
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,042
one that just draws a plane like this,

65
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,660
in terms of actual
function what this means,

66
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,327
so kind of a linear,

67
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:31,423
this is going to be some
kind of function of x and y,

68
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:33,697
and what it looks like
is some kind of constant,

69
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:37,888
which I'll say a plus another
constant times the variable x,

70
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:40,504
plus another constant
times the variable y,

71
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:43,148
this is sort of the basic
form of linear functions.

72
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:44,947
And technically this isn't
linear if one is going

73
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:46,677
to be really pedantic
and they would say that

74
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:50,024
that's actually affine,
because I'm strictly speaking

75
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:52,106
linear functions shouldn't
have this constant term,

76
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,004
it should be purely x's and y's,

77
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:55,650
but in the context of approximations

78
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,969
people would usually
call this a linear term.

79
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:01,528
So quadratic term, what
this is going to look like,

80
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:04,482
quadratic,

81
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:07,055
we are allowed to have all
the same terms as that linear

82
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:09,123
one, so you can have constant,

83
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:12,540
you can have these two
linear terms bx and cy,

84
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,509
and then you're allowed
to have anything that

85
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:16,843
has two variables multiplied into it.

86
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:20,823
So maybe I'll have d times x squared,

87
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:23,763
and then you can also
have something times xy,

88
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:25,394
this is considered a quadratic term.

89
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:26,463
Which is a little bit weird at first,

90
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:28,263
because usually we think
of quadratics as associated

91
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:29,992
with that exponent two,

92
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,553
but really it's just saying any time

93
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:33,691
you have two variables multiplied in,

94
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,759
and then we can add some other constants,

95
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,038
say f times y squared.

96
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:40,666
Where, you know, now we're
multiplying two y's into it.

97
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,635
So all of these guys,
these are what you would

98
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:44,422
call your quadratic terms.

99
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:47,178
Things that either x squared,
y squared, or x times y,

100
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:48,936
anything that has two variables in it.

101
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:50,441
So you can see this gives
us a lot more control

102
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:53,183
because previously, as
we tweaked the constants

103
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:56,428
a, b, and c, you're able to give yourself,

104
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:58,475
you know, that gives you
control over all sorts

105
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:00,472
of planes in space, and
if you choose the most

106
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:02,314
optimal one you'll get
one that's tangent to

107
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:04,283
your curve at this specific point,

108
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:06,294
and kind of, it'll depend
on where that point is,

109
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,208
you'll get different planes,
but they're all tangent.

110
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,781
So what we're going to do in
the next couple of videos,

111
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:13,241
is talk about how you tweak all of these

112
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,125
six different constants so
that you can get functions

113
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,909
that really closely hug the curve, right?

114
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:20,619
And as you, and they're
all going to depend on the

115
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,708
original point because as
you move that point around,

116
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,394
what it takes to hug the curve
is going to be different.

117
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:27,547
It's going to have to do
with partial differential

118
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:29,880
information about your original function,

119
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,455
the function whose graph this is,

120
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,114
and it's going to look pretty similar to

121
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:34,619
the local linearization case,

122
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:36,504
just you know, added complexity so we have

123
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:38,543
to add a few more steps in there.

124
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:40,911
And I'll see you next
video talking about that.
