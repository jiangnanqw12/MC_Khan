00:00:00,564 --> 00:00:01,714
- [Voiceover] Hello hello again.

2
00:00:01,714 --> 00:00:02,643
So, in the last video,

3
00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:04,756
I started talking about how you interpret

4
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:08,123
the partial derivative of a
parametric surface function,

5
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:10,514
of a function that has
a two variable input,

6
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:13,440
and a three variable vector-valued output.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,495
And we typically visualize
those as a surface

8
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:16,958
in three dimensional space,

9
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,965
and the whole process,
I was saying, you think

10
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:22,965
about how a portion of the t-s plane

11
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:25,811
moves to that corresponding output.

12
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:27,762
And again, I'm kind of
cheating with this animation,

13
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,488
where, really, this isn't
the t-s plane, right?

14
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,855
This is on the x-y plane.

15
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:33,875
t-s plane should just be some
separate space over here,

16
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,373
and we're imagining
moving that separate space

17
00:00:35,373 --> 00:00:37,149
over into three dimensions.

18
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:40,597
But that's harder to animate,
so I'm just not gonna do it,

19
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:44,764
and I'm gonna instead keep
things inside the x-y plane here.

20
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:46,648
We're thinking about the squares

21
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:50,165
being t and s ranging each from 0 to 3.

22
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:53,183
And, what I said, for partial
derivative with respect to t,

23
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:54,657
is you imagine the line

24
00:00:54,657 --> 00:00:57,432
that represents movement
in the t direction.

25
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,661
You see how that line gets mapped

26
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:02,401
as all of the points move to
their corresponding output.

27
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:05,617
And the partial derivative vector

28
00:01:05,617 --> 00:01:07,918
gives you a certain tangent vector

29
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:10,298
to the curve representing that line,

30
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:13,003
which corresponds to
movement in the t direction.

31
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,337
And the longer that is,
the faster the movement,

32
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:19,087
The more sensitive it is to
nudges in the t direction.

33
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:20,747
In the s direction,
let's say we were to take

34
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,872
the partial derivative with respect to s.

35
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:25,789
So I'll kind of clear this up here.

36
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:28,793
Also clear up this guy.

37
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,012
And if you said instead,

38
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:32,694
"what if we were doing it
with respect to s," right?

39
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:34,273
Partial derivative of v,

40
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:36,676
the vector-valued function,
with respect to s.

41
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:38,393
Well, you do something very similar.

42
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:40,972
You would say "OK, What is
the line that corresponds

43
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:43,468
"to movement in the s direction?"

44
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:44,301
And the way I've drawn it,

45
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:45,825
it's always going to be perpendicular,

46
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:47,503
because we're in the t-s plane,

47
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:50,557
the t axis is perpendicular
to the s plane.

48
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:53,982
And in this case, this line
represents t = 1, right?

49
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,584
You're saying t constantly equals 1,

50
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:57,500
but you're letting s vary.

51
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,555
And if you see how that line maps,

52
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:01,865
as you move everything
from the input space

53
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:05,325
over to the corresponding
points in the output space,

54
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,821
that line tells you what happens

55
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:11,861
as you're varying the
s value of the input.

56
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:13,638
It kind of starts curving this way,

57
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:15,820
and then it curves very much up and

58
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,282
kind of goes off into the distance there.

59
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:19,942
And again, the grid
lines here really help,

60
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:22,461
because every time that you
see the grid lines intersect,

61
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:25,120
one of the lines represents
movement in the t direction,

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,046
and the other represents
movement in the s direction.

63
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,995
And for partial derivatives,
we think very similarly.

64
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:34,661
You think of that partial
s as representing-

65
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:35,923
(voiced zooming sounds)

66
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,033
Zoom on back here.

67
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,158
That partial s you
think of as representing

68
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:42,654
a tiny movement in the s direction,

69
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:45,278
just a little smidge and nudge,

70
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:47,542
somehow nudging that guy along.

71
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,423
And then the corresponding nudge

72
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:51,280
you look for in the output space,

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,614
you say okay, if we nudge
the input that much,

74
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:56,614
and we go over to the output, and...

75
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,001
and maybe that tiny nudge

76
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,638
corresponded with one
that's three times bigger.

77
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:04,974
I don't know, but it looked
like it stretched things out.

78
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:06,266
So that tiny nudge might
turn into something

79
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,624
that's still quite small,

80
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:10,062
but maybe three times bigger.

81
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:11,363
But it's a vector.

82
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:13,046
What you do is, you think of that vector

83
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:15,647
as being your partial v,

84
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:18,004
and you scale it by whatever the size

85
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:19,943
of that partial s was, right?

86
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:22,613
So the result that you get

87
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:26,398
is a tangent vector that's
not puny, not a tiny nudge,

88
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:30,538
but is actually a sizable tangent vector.

89
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:32,801
And it's going to correspond to the rate

90
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:35,739
at which changes, not just tiny changes,

91
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,881
but the rate at which changes in s

92
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:40,146
cause movement in the output space.

93
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:42,143
So, let's actually
compute it for this case,

94
00:03:42,143 --> 00:03:46,659
just get some good
practice computing things.

95
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,016
And if we look up here, the t value

96
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:50,653
which used to be considered a variable

97
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:52,069
when we were doing it with respect to t.

98
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,915
But now that t value
looks like a constant,

99
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:55,517
so its derivative is zero.

100
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:58,037
Then -s², with respect to s,

101
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,037
has a derivative of -2s.

102
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:05,514
st: s looks like a variable,
t looks like a constant,

103
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:08,370
the derivative is just that constant, t.

104
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,168
Down here, ts²: t looks like a constant,

105
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,301
s looks like a variable, so...

106
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,801
2 times t times s.

107
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,622
And then over here, we're subtracting off,

108
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:21,081
s is the variable, t²
looks like a constant,

109
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:22,498
so that constant.

110
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:27,873
And let's say we plug in the value (1,1).

111
00:04:27,873 --> 00:04:30,532
This red dot corresponds to (1,1),

112
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:32,946
so what we would get here,

113
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:35,071
s is equal to 1, so that's -2,

114
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:36,952
t is equal to 1, so that's 1,

115
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:39,564
then 2 times 1 times 1, I'll write it.

116
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:40,397
2*1*1

117
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:41,230
minus 1²

118
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:47,078
is gonna correspond to 1, that's 2-1.

119
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,818
So what we would expect
for the tangent vector,

120
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:51,478
the partial derivative vector,

121
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:53,243
is the x-component should be negative,

122
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:55,994
and then the y and z-components
should each be positive.

123
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,597
And if we go over, and we take a look

124
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:01,300
at what the movement along
the curve actually is,

125
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,257
that lines up, right?

126
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:05,782
Because, as you kind of
zip along this curve,

127
00:05:05,782 --> 00:05:10,124
you're moving to the
left, so the x-component

128
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:12,155
of the partial derivative
should be negative.

129
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:15,337
But you're moving upwards
as far as y is concerned,

130
00:05:15,337 --> 00:05:17,241
and you can also kinda see
that the leftward movement

131
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:19,291
is kind of twice as fast
as the upward motion.

132
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,836
The slope favors the x direction.

133
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,940
And then as far as the z
component is concerned,

134
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,739
you are, in fact, moving up.

135
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:26,700
And maybe you could say,

136
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,032
"Well, how do you know
which way you're moving,

137
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:30,263
"are you moving that way, or is everything

138
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,878
"switched the other way around?"

139
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:35,477
And the benefit of animation here is,

140
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:38,833
we can say, "Ah, as s is ranging from zero

141
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,898
"up to three, this is the
increasing direction."

142
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:44,463
And you just keep your eye
on what that direction is

143
00:05:44,463 --> 00:05:47,052
as we move things about.

144
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:49,014
And that increasing direction
does kind of correspond

145
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:51,197
with moving along the curve this way.

146
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:54,959
So, you get a tangent
vector in the other way.

147
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,898
And one kinda nice thing
about this, then, is

148
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,775
the two different partial
derivative vectors that we found

149
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:02,134
Each one of them, you could say,

150
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:04,246
is a tangent vector to the surface, right?

151
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:05,554
So the one that was a partial derivative

152
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:07,923
with respect to t, over here,

153
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:09,281
kinda goes in one direction,

154
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:11,092
and the other one kinda
gives you a different notion

155
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:15,458
of what a tangent vector
on the surface could be.

156
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,836
And you could have a notion
of directional derivative too,

157
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,065
that kind of combines
these in various ways,

158
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,520
and that will get you
all the different ways

159
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,069
that you can have a vector
tangent to the surface.

160
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,693
And later on, I'll talk about
things like tangent planes,

161
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:31,874
if you want to express
what a tangent plane is.

162
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:34,475
And you kind of think
of that as being defined

163
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:36,437
in terms of two different vectors.

164
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,492
But for now, that's really
all you need to know

165
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:42,915
about partial derivatives
of parametric surfaces.

166
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:44,599
And the next couple
videos, I'll talk about

167
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:47,072
what partial derivatives
of vector-valued functions

168
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:48,468
can mean in other contexts,

169
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:50,601
because it's not always
a parametric surface,

170
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,134
and maybe you're not always thinking

171
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:54,119
about a curve that could be moved along,

172
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,418
but you still want to think,
"How does this input nudge

173
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:57,834
"correspond to an output nudge,

174
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,110
"and what's the ratio between them."

175
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,903
So with that, I'll see you next video.
