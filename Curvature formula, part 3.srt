00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,731
- [Voiceover] So continuing
on with where we were

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:04,031
in the last video, we're looking for this

3
00:00:04,031 --> 00:00:08,095
unit tangent vector function
given the parameterization.

4
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:10,603
So the specific example
that I have is a function

5
00:00:10,603 --> 00:00:14,434
that parameterizes a circle
with radius capital R,

6
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:16,384
but I also wanna show in parallel

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,358
what this looks like more abstractly.

8
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:21,121
So here, I'll just write
down in the abstract half

9
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,627
what we did here, what we did
for the unit tangent vector.

10
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:27,692
So we actually have the
same thing over here

11
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,690
where the unit tangent vector

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,607
should be

13
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,582
the derivative function,

14
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:38,043
which we know gives a tangent.

15
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:39,633
It's just it might not be unit.

16
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:40,847
But then we normalize it.

17
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:45,769
We take the magnitude of
that tangent vector function.

18
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:47,720
And in our specific case with the circle,

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,878
once we did this and we kinda
took the x-components squared,

20
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:52,991
y-components squared, and
simplified it all out,

21
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:54,686
we got the function R.

22
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:57,844
But in general case, we
might not be so lucky.

23
00:00:57,844 --> 00:01:01,977
Because the magnitude of this derivative

24
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:04,229
is gonna be the square root

25
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,229
of x-prime of t-squared.

26
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:10,894
Right? This is the
x-component of the derivative.

27
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:13,540
Plus y-prime of t-squared.

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,653
Just taking the magnitude
of a vector here.

29
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:19,392
So when we take the entire
function and divide it by that,

30
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:21,505
what we get doesn't simplify as it did

31
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:23,362
in the case of a circle.

32
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:26,752
Instead, we have that x-prime
of t, which is the x-component

33
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:28,749
of our s-prime of t, and we have to

34
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:31,118
divide it by that entire magnitude,

35
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,161
which was this whole expression, right?

36
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:35,971
You have to divide it by that
whole square root expression,

37
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,084
and I'm just gonna write
"..." with the understanding

38
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:40,708
that this square root expression
is what goes up there.

39
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:44,585
And similarly, over here, we
have y-prime of t, divided by

40
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:47,767
that entire expression again, right?

41
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:50,042
So simplification doesn't always happen.

42
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,364
That was just kind of a lucky happenstance

43
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:53,827
of our circle example.

44
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:55,244
Now what we want,

45
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:59,168
once we have the unit tangent vector

46
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:01,490
as a function of that same parameter,

47
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,974
what we're hoping to
find is the derivative

48
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:07,689
of that unit tangent vector
with respect to arc length,

49
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:10,870
the arc length s, and
to find its magnitude.

50
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,867
That's gonna be what curvature is.

51
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,700
But the way to do this

52
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,753
is to take the derivative

53
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:24,036
with respect to the parameter
t; so d big T, d little t,

54
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,953
and then divided out by

55
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:31,931
the derivative of our function s

56
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:35,971
with respect to t, which we already found.

57
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,270
And the reason I'm doing this,
you know, loosely if you're

58
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,617
just thinking of the
notation, you might say,

59
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,333
oh, you can kinda cancel
out the dt's from each one.

60
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,632
But another way to think
about this is to say,

61
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:48,138
when we have our tangent vector
function as a function of t,

62
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:51,157
the parameter t, we're not
sure of what it changes

63
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:53,317
with respect to s, right?

64
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:55,012
That's something we don't know directly.

65
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:57,752
But we do directly know
its change with respect

66
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,888
to a tiny change in that parameter.

67
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,187
So then if we just kind
of correct that by saying,

68
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:04,764
hey, how much does the
length of the curve change?

69
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:06,831
How far do you move along the curve

70
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:08,595
as you change that parameter?

71
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:11,544
And maybe if I go back
up to the picture here,

72
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:16,425
this ds/dt is saying for a
tiny nudge in time, right,

73
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:19,880
what is the ratio of the
size of the movement there

74
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,761
with respect to that tiny time?

75
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,997
So the reason that this comes
out to be a very large vector,

76
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:26,850
it's not a tiny thing, is
because you're taking the ratio.

77
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,842
Maybe this tiny change was just
an itty-bitty smidgen vector

78
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,581
but your dividing it by 1/1,000,000

79
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:35,089
or whatever the size of
dt that you're thinking.

80
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,863
And in this specific case for our circle,

81
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:39,176
we saw that the magnitude of this guy,

82
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,878
if we took the magnitude of that guy,

83
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:42,155
it's gonna be equal to R.

84
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,455
Which is a little bit poetic, right?

85
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:45,615
That the magnitude of the derivative

86
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:49,307
is the same as the
distance from the center.

87
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:52,604
And what this means in our specific case,

88
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:55,042
if we want to apply this
to our circle example,

89
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:58,075
we take dT, the tangent vector fuction,

90
00:03:58,075 --> 00:04:00,852
and i'll go ahead and write it here,

91
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:02,872
we have the derivative
of our tangent vector

92
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:05,449
with respect to the parameter,

93
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,191
and we go up and look
here and we say okay,

94
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:09,768
the unit tangent vector

95
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:12,578
has the formula -sin(t) and cos(t).

96
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:17,222
So the derivative of -sin(t) is -cos.

97
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:21,389
So over here, this guy
should look like -cos(t).

98
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:27,230
The other component, the y component,

99
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,621
the derivative of cos(t),
as we're differentiating

100
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:33,788
our unit tangent vector
function, is -sin, -sin(t).

101
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:42,817
And what this implies
is that the magnitude

102
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:46,409
of that derivative of the
tangent vector with respect to t,

103
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,802
well what's the magnitude of this vector?

104
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:49,219
you've got a cosine, you've got a sine.

105
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:50,287
There's nothing else in there.

106
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:53,120
You're going to end up with
cosine squared plus sin squared.

107
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,906
So this magnitude just equals one.

108
00:04:55,906 --> 00:04:57,625
And when we do what we're
supposed to do over here

109
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,180
and divide by the magnitude
of the derivative.

110
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,013
We take this and we
divide it by the magnitude

111
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:07,888
of the derivative ds/dt.

112
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:10,697
Well we've already computed the
magnitude of the derivative.

113
00:05:10,697 --> 00:05:11,882
That was R.

114
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:15,457
That's how we got this R, is
we took the derivative here

115
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:18,624
and took it's magnitude and found it.

116
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,098
So we find that in the
specific case of the circle

117
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,979
the curvature function that we want

118
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:27,346
is just constantly equal to 1/R.

119
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:29,436
Which is good and
helpful, because I said in

120
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:30,899
the original video on curvature

121
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,101
that it's defined by one divided
by the radius of the circle

122
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,687
that hugs the curve most closely.

123
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,008
And if your curve is actually a circle,

124
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:40,262
it's literally a circle.

125
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:43,048
Then the curve that hugs it
most closely is its self.

126
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,766
So I should hope that its curvature

127
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:47,204
ends up being one divided by R.

128
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:48,737
And in the more general case,

129
00:05:48,737 --> 00:05:52,731
if we take a look at what this ought to be

130
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:56,121
you can maybe imagine just how
horrifying it's going to be

131
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:57,166
to compute this.

132
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,279
We've got our tangent vector function,

133
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,878
which itself is almost too
long for me to write down.

134
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:05,293
I just put these dot dot
dots where you're filling in

135
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:07,174
x prime of t squared
plus y prime of t squared

136
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:08,985
and you're gonna have to take this,

137
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:11,992
take it's derivative with respect to t.

138
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:13,197
It's not going to get any simpler

139
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:14,417
when you take it's derivative.

140
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,622
Take the magnitude of that
and divide all of that

141
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:19,642
by the magnitude of the derivative

142
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:21,894
of your original function.

143
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:22,916
And I think what I'll do,

144
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,820
I'm not going to do all of that here.

145
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,213
It's a little bit much and
I'm not sure how helpful

146
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:28,256
it is to walk through all those steps.

147
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:30,486
But for the sake of having
it, for anyone whose curious,

148
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:32,784
I think I'll put that into an article,

149
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:34,921
and you can go through
the steps at your own pace

150
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:37,336
and see what the formula comes out to be.

151
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:39,007
And I'll just tell you right now,

152
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,795
maybe kind of a spoiler alert,

153
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:42,862
what that formula comes out to be

154
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:46,716
is x prime, the derivative
of that first component,

155
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:50,687
multiplied by y double prime,
the second derivative of

156
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:53,659
that second component, minus y prime,

157
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,376
the first derivative of
that second component,

158
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:59,673
multiplied by x double prime.

159
00:06:59,673 --> 00:07:02,090
And all of that is divided by

160
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:04,681
the

161
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:08,600
the magnitude component,

162
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,267
the x prime squared plus y prime squared.

163
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:17,181
That whole thing to the three halves.

164
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:19,247
And you can maybe see why you're going

165
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:20,846
to get terms like this, right,

166
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:24,482
cause when you're taking the derivative,

167
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:26,573
when you're taking the derivative of

168
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:27,978
the unit tangent vector function

169
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,603
you have the square root term in it,

170
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:31,600
the square root that has
x primes and y primes,

171
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,761
so that's where you're going

172
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:33,829
to get your x double
prime, y double prime.

173
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,546
As the chain rule takes you down there.

174
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:38,450
And you can maybe see why this whole

175
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,168
x prime squared, y prime squared term

176
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,258
is going to maintain
itself and it turns out

177
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:45,881
it comes in here as a three halves power.

178
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:48,272
And what I'm going to do in the next video

179
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:51,430
I'm going to go ahead and
describe kind of an intuition

180
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,450
for why this formula isn't random.

181
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,711
Why if you break down what this is saying

182
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:59,401
it really does give a
feeling for the curvature.

183
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:01,445
The amount that the curve curves

184
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:03,511
that we want to try to measure.

185
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:05,160
So it's almost like this is a third way

186
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,019
of thinking about it.

187
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,830
The first one, I said you have

188
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,036
whatever circle most
closely hugs your curve

189
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:12,567
and you take 1 divided by its radius.

190
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:15,237
And then the second way
you're thinking of this dt/ds,

191
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:18,186
the change in the unit tangent vector

192
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:20,880
with respect to arc length
and taking its magnitude.

193
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,784
And of course all of these are the same,

194
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:24,897
they're just kind of three different ways

195
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:26,592
to think about it or things
that you might plug in

196
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:28,055
when you come across a function.

197
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:29,169
And I'll go through an example,

198
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,120
I'll go through something
where we're really computing

199
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,070
the curvature of something
that's not just a circle.

200
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,403
But with that, I'll see you next video.
