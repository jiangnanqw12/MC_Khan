00:00:00,592 --> 00:00:01,425
- [Voiceover] Hey guys.

2
00:00:01,425 --> 00:00:04,209
Before talking about the
vector form for the quadratic

3
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:06,917
approximation of multivariable functions,

4
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:11,084
I've got to introduce this
thing called the Hessian matrix.

5
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:16,645
Essentially what this is,
is just a way to package

6
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:19,498
all the information of the
second derivatives of a function.

7
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:23,249
Let's say you have some kind
of multivariable function

8
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:25,965
like the example we had in the last video,

9
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:29,198
e to the x halves multiplied by sine of y,

10
00:00:29,198 --> 00:00:31,006
so some kind of of a
multivariable function.

11
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:33,101
What the Hessian matrix
is, and it's often denoted

12
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:37,101
with an H, but a bold
faced H, is it's a matrix,

13
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:41,120
incidentally enough, that contains all

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,358
the second partial derivatives of f.

15
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:46,821
The first component is gonna
be, the partial derivative

16
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:50,466
of f with respect to x twice
in a row, and everything

17
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:52,413
in this first column is
kind of like you first do it

18
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:56,294
with respect to x, because
the next part is the second

19
00:00:56,294 --> 00:00:59,788
derivative where first you
do it with respect to x

20
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:03,001
and then you do it with respect to y.

21
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,134
That's the first column of the matrix.

22
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:10,115
Then up here it's the partial
derivative where first you do

23
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:13,935
it with respect to y and then
you do it with respect to x,

24
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:15,497
and then over here it's
where you do it with

25
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:18,193
respect to y both times in a row.

26
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,026
Partial with respect to
y both times in a row.

27
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,408
Let's go ahead and actually compute this

28
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:25,997
and think about what this would look like

29
00:01:25,997 --> 00:01:28,363
in the case of our specific function here.

30
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:30,609
In order to get all the second
partial derivatives we first

31
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:33,869
should keep a record of the
first partial derivatives.

32
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,697
The partial derivative
of f with respect to x.

33
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,056
The only place x shows up is
in this e to the x halves.

34
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:44,712
Bring down that 1/2 e to
the x halves and sine of y

35
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:47,734
just looks like a constant
as far as x is concerned.

36
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:48,942
Sine of y.

37
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,582
Then the partial derivative
with respect of y.

38
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:55,362
Partial derivative of f with respect to y.

39
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:57,830
Now e to the x halves
looks like a constant

40
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,626
and it's being multiplied by
something that has a y in it,

41
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:02,416
e to the x halves.

42
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,530
The derivative of sine of
y, since we're doing it

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,280
with respect to y is cosine of y.

44
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,659
These terms won't be included
in the Hessian itself

45
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:14,114
but we're just keeping a record of them

46
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:16,309
because now when we go
into fill in the matrix,

47
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:19,115
this upper left component,
we're taking the second partial

48
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:22,142
derivative where we do it with
respect to x then x again.

49
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,352
Up here is when we did
it with respect to x,

50
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,536
if we did it with respect
to x again we bring down

51
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:32,291
another 1/2 so that becomes
1/4 by e to the x halves

52
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:36,953
and that sine of y just
still looks like a constant.

53
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:38,890
Then this mixed partial
derivative where we do it with

54
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,631
respect to x then y, so we
did it with respect to x here.

55
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:44,642
When we differentiate
this with respect to y,

56
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:48,809
the 1/2 e to the x halves
just looks like a constant

57
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,958
but then derivative of sine
of y ends up as cosine of y.

58
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,459
Then up here, it's gonna be
the same thing but let's see

59
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,593
when you do it in the other direction,

60
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:03,010
when you do it first
with respect to y then x.

61
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,193
Over here we did it
first with respect to y.

62
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:07,603
If we took this derivative
with respect to x,

63
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:10,079
you'd have the 1/2 would
come down, so that would be

64
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,246
1/2 e to the x halves
multiplied by cosine of y

65
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:17,667
because that's just looks
like a constant since

66
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,736
we're doing it with respect
to x the second time.

67
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:24,625
That would be cosine of y,
and it shouldn't feel like a

68
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,537
surprise that both of these
terms turn out to be the same.

69
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:29,298
With most functions that's the case.

70
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:30,375
Technically not all functions.

71
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,297
You can come up with some crazy things

72
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:34,246
where this won't be
symmetric, where youâ€™ll

73
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,951
have different terms in the
diagonal, but for the most part

74
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,580
those you can expect to be the same.

75
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,458
In this last term here where
we do it with respect to

76
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,558
y twice, we now think of taking
the derivative of this whole

77
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,206
term with respect to y, that
e to the x halves looks like

78
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:52,373
a constant and derivative of
cosine is negative sine of y.

79
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:59,653
This whole thing, a matrix,
each of whose components

80
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,940
is a multivariable
function, is the Hessian.

81
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,080
This is the Hessian of f,
and sometimes bold write it

82
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,633
as Hessian of f specifying
what function its of.

83
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:12,410
You could think of it as
a matrix valued function

84
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,061
which feels kind of weird
but you plug in two different

85
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:17,195
values, x and y, and you'll get a matrix,

86
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:19,420
so it's this matrix valued function.

87
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,814
The nice thing about
writing it like this is that

88
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:22,631
you can actually extend
this so that rather

89
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,866
than just for functions
that have two variables,

90
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,610
let's say you had a function,
kind of like clear this up,

91
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,675
let's say u had a function
that had three variables

92
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:32,263
or four variables or any number.

93
00:04:32,263 --> 00:04:35,202
Let's say it was a
function of x, y, and z,

94
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:38,514
then you can follow this
pattern and following down

95
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:40,787
the first column here the
next term that you would get

96
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:44,106
would be the second
partial derivative of f,

97
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:46,529
where first you do with respect to x,

98
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:48,617
and then you do it with respect to z.

99
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:51,584
Then over here it would be
the second partial derivative

100
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:55,417
of f, where first you
did it with respect to y

101
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,567
and then you do it with respect to z,

102
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:03,157
I'll clear up even more room here,

103
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:05,013
because you'd have another
column where you'd have the

104
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,661
second partial derivative,
where this time everything first

105
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:12,054
you do it with respect to z
and then with respect to x.

106
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:14,910
Then over here you'd have
the second partial derivative

107
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,627
where first you do it with respect

108
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:19,092
to z and then with respect to y.

109
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:20,790
Then there is the very
last component you'd have

110
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,919
the second partial derivative
where first you do it with

111
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,014
respect to, well, I guess you
do it with respect to z twice.

112
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:31,114
This whole thing, this three
by three matrix would be

113
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:33,999
the Hessian of a three variable function.

114
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,798
You can see how you could
extend this pattern where if it

115
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:38,349
was a four variable function
you'd get a four by four matrix

116
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:40,830
of all of the possible
second partial derivatives.

117
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,769
If it was a 100 variable function

118
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:45,555
you would have a 100 by 100 matrix.

119
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,827
The nice thing about having
this is then we can talk

120
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:50,158
about that by just referencing the symbol

121
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:51,594
and we'll see in the
next video how this makes

122
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:54,300
it very nice to express,
for example the quadratic

123
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,055
approximation of any kind
of multivariable function

124
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,525
not just a two variable
function and the symbols

125
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,095
don't get way out of hand
'cause you don't have to

126
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,446
reference each one of these
individual components.

127
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,131
You can just reference
the matrix as a whole

128
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,794
and start doing matrix operations.

129
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:09,379
I will see you in that next video.
