1
00:00:00,794 --> 00:00:01,666
- [Narrator] In the last video we were

2
00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:03,543
looking at this particular function.

3
00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:04,977
It's a very non linear function.

4
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:06,960
And we were picturing
it as a transformation

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,641
that takes every point x,
y in space to the point

6
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:13,401
x plus sign y, y plus sign of x.

7
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:16,634
And moreover, we zoomed
in on a specific point.

8
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:17,731
And let me actually write down what

9
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,958
point we zoomed in on, it was (-2,1).

10
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:25,125
That's something we're gonna
want to record here (-2,1).

11
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:27,948
And I added couple extra
grid lines around it

12
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:30,531
just so we can see in detail
what the transformation

13
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,803
does to points that are in the
neighborhood of that point.

14
00:00:33,803 --> 00:00:35,732
And over here, this
square shows the zoomed

15
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:37,773
in version of that neighborhood.

16
00:00:37,773 --> 00:00:39,853
And what we saw is that even though the

17
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:41,716
function as a whole, as a transformation,

18
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:44,565
looks rather complicated,
around that one point,

19
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:47,426
it looks like a linear function.

20
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:49,706
It's locally linear so
what I'll show you here

21
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:52,907
is what matrix is gonna
tell you the linear

22
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:55,131
function that this looks like.

23
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:57,730
And this is gonna be kind
of two by two matrix.

24
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,347
I'll make a lot of room
for ourselves here.

25
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:02,788
It'll be a two by two matrix and the way

26
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:05,658
to think about it is to first go back

27
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:07,823
to our original setup
before the transformation.

28
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:10,334
And think of just a
tiny step to the right.

29
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:13,576
What I'm gonna think of
as a little, partial x.

30
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:16,118
A tiny step in the x direction.

31
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,301
And what that turns into
after the transformation

32
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:21,733
is gonna be some tiny
step in the output space.

33
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,457
And here let me actually kind of draw on

34
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:25,743
what that tiny step turned into.

35
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:27,150
It's no longer purely in the x direction.

36
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,486
It has some rightward component.

37
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:30,357
But now also some downward component.

38
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,620
And to be able to represent
this in a nice way,

39
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,366
what I'm gonna do is
instead of writing the

40
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,137
entire function as something with

41
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:39,081
a vector valued output, I'm gonna go ahead

42
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:43,248
and represent this as a two
separate scalar value functions.

43
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:48,283
I'm gonna write the scalar
value functions f1 of x, y.

44
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:52,964
So I'm just giving a
name to x plus sign y.

45
00:01:52,964 --> 00:01:56,083
And f2 of x, y, again all I'm doing is

46
00:01:56,083 --> 00:02:00,348
giving a name to the functions
we already have written down.

47
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:02,296
When I look at this vector, the

48
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:04,334
consequence of taking a tiny d, x step

49
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:06,812
in the input space that corresponds to

50
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,423
some two d movement in the output space.

51
00:02:09,423 --> 00:02:11,189
And the x component of that movement.

52
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:12,896
Right if I was gonna draw this out

53
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:15,976
and say hey, what's the x
component of that movement.

54
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:18,071
That's something we think of as a little

55
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:22,238
partial change in f1, the
x component of our output.

56
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,560
And if we divide this, if we take you know

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,913
partial f1 divided by the size of that

58
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,717
initial tiny change, it basically scales

59
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:31,408
it up to be a normal sized vector.

60
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:32,938
Not a tiny nudge but something that's more

61
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:34,480
constant that doesn't shrink as we

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,617
zoom in further and further.

63
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:39,149
And then similarly the
change in the y direction,

64
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:40,784
right the vertical component of that step

65
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:43,185
that was still caused by the dx.

66
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:45,493
Right, it's still caused by that initial

67
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:46,933
step to the right, that is gonna be

68
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,516
the tiny, partial change in f2.

69
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,667
The y component of the output cause

70
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,527
here we're all just
looking in the output space

71
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:58,694
that was caused by a partial
change in the x direction.

72
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:02,220
And again I kind of
like to think about this

73
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,957
we're dividing by a tiny amount.

74
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:07,065
This partial f2 is really
a tiny, tiny nudge.

75
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:08,847
But by dividing by the size of the initial

76
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:11,210
tiny nudge that caused it, we're getting

77
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,483
something that's basically a number.

78
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,471
Something that doesn't shrink when

79
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:15,592
we consider more and
more zoomed in versions.

80
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,517
So that, that's all what happens when

81
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:19,922
we take a tiny step in the x direction.

82
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:23,066
But another thing you could
do, another thing you can

83
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:25,960
consider is a tiny step
in the y direction.

84
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,835
Right cause we wanna know, hey, if

85
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:31,153
you take a single step
some tiny unit upward,

86
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:35,320
what does that turn into
after the transformation.

87
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:41,584
And what that looks like is this vector

88
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:43,398
that still has some upward component.

89
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:45,328
But it also has a rightward component.

90
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:46,413
And now I'm gonna write its components

91
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:48,815
as the second column of the matrix.

92
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:50,092
Because as we know when
you're representing

93
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,439
a linear transformation with a matrix,

94
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,012
the first column tells you where the first

95
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:55,596
basis vector goes and the second column

96
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:58,195
shows where the second basis vector goes.

97
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,756
If that feels unfamiliar, either

98
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,245
check out the refresher video or

99
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:03,959
maybe go and look at some of
the linear algebra content.

100
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,017
But to figure out the
coordinates of this guy,

101
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:08,085
we do basically the same thing.

102
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,671
Let's say first of all, the
change in the x direction

103
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:14,682
here, the x component
of this nudge vector.

104
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:18,921
That's gonna be given as a
partial change to f1, right,

105
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:21,077
to the x component of the output.

106
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,271
Here we're looking in the outputs base.

107
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:25,241
We're dealing with f1, f1 and f2

108
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,713
and we're asking what that change was

109
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:30,880
that was caused by a tiny
change in the y direction.

110
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,315
So the change in f1 caused
by some tiny step in the y

111
00:04:35,315 --> 00:04:38,981
direction divided by the
size of that tiny step.

112
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:41,811
And then the y component
of our output here.

113
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:43,891
The y component of the
step in the outputs base

114
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,888
that was caused by the initial tiny

115
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:47,876
step upward in the input space.

116
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,376
Well that is the change of f2,

117
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:55,537
second component of our
output as caused by dy.

118
00:04:55,537 --> 00:04:58,953
As caused by that little partial y.

119
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:00,477
And of course all of this is very specific

120
00:05:00,477 --> 00:05:02,545
to the point that we started at right.

121
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:05,447
We started at the point (-2,1).

122
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:07,527
So each of these partial derivatives

123
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:09,287
is something that really we're saying,

124
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:12,714
don't take the function,
evaluate it at the point (2,-1),

125
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:16,506
and when you evaluate each one of these

126
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:18,900
at the point (2,-1)
you'll get some number.

127
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,972
And that will give you a very

128
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:21,753
concrete two by two matrix that's gonna

129
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:24,065
represent the linear
transformation that this

130
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:26,947
guy looks like once you've zoomed in.

131
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:28,268
So this matrix here that's full of all

132
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:31,582
of the partial derivatives
has a very special name.

133
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,553
It's called as you may
have guessed, the Jacobian.

134
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:38,775
Or more fully you'd call
it the Jacobian Matrix.

135
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:39,980
And one way to think about it is that it

136
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,186
carries all of the partial
differential information right.

137
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:45,489
It's taking into account
both of these components

138
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:48,069
of the output and both possible inputs.

139
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:49,240
And giving you a kind of a grid of

140
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,194
what all the partial derivatives are.

141
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,260
But as I hope you see, it's much

142
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,526
more than just a way of recording

143
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:56,402
what all the partial derivatives are.

144
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:57,893
There's a reason for organizing it

145
00:05:57,893 --> 00:05:59,786
like this in particular and it really

146
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:02,439
does come down to this
idea of local linearity.

147
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,541
If you understand that the Jacobian Matrix

148
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,148
is fundamentally supposed to represent

149
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,689
what a transformation
looks like when you zoom

150
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:11,462
in near a specific point,
almost everything else

151
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,999
about it will start to fall in place.

152
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:14,981
And in the next video, I'll go ahead

153
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:16,429
and actually compute this just to

154
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:18,135
show you what the process looks like.

155
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:19,383
And how the result we get kind of

156
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:20,760
matches with the picture we're

157
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,593
looking at, see you then.
