00:00:00,507 --> 00:00:01,360
- [Voiceover] Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,583
So in the last video I introduced

3
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:05,109
this thing called the second
partial derivative test,

4
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:07,307
and if you have some kind
of multivariable function

5
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:08,971
or really just a two variable function

6
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:10,639
is what this applies to, something that's

7
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,836
f of x, y and it outputs a number.

8
00:00:12,836 --> 00:00:14,300
When you're looking
for places where it has

9
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,863
a local maximum or a local
minimum, the first step,

10
00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:18,733
as I talked about a few videos ago,

11
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:21,541
is to find where the gradient equals zero

12
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,844
and sometimes you'll hear these called

13
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:24,431
critical points or stable points,

14
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:26,873
but inputs where the gradient equals zero

15
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:28,504
and that's really just a way of compactly

16
00:00:28,504 --> 00:00:29,970
writing the fact that all the partial

17
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,923
derivatives are equal to zero.

18
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:33,507
Now when you find a point like this,

19
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:35,665
in order to test whether
it's a local maximum

20
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:37,579
or a local minimum or a saddle point

21
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,570
without actually looking at the graph,

22
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,482
'cause you don't always have the ability

23
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:43,880
to do that at your
disposal, the first step

24
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,155
is to compute this long value,

25
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:48,437
and this is the thing I
wanna give intuition behind.

26
00:00:48,437 --> 00:00:50,920
Where you take all three
second partial derivatives,

27
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,750
the second partial
derivative with respect to x,

28
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,233
the second partial
derivative with respect to y

29
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,860
and the mixed partial derivative

30
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,286
where first you do it with respect to x,

31
00:00:58,286 --> 00:01:00,559
then you do it with respect to y.

32
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,228
And you compute this
value where you evaluate

33
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,544
each one of those at your critical point

34
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:07,714
and you multiply the two pure
second partial derivatives

35
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:09,661
and then subtract off the square

36
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,286
of the mixed partial derivative

37
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:13,077
and again, I'll give intuition
for that in a reason,

38
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:14,459
but right now we just kinda take it,

39
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,283
oh, alright, I guess
you compute this number

40
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:19,285
and if that value H, if that value H

41
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:21,971
is greater than zero, what it tells you,

42
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:24,003
what it tells you is
that you definitely have

43
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:26,273
either a maximum or a minimum.

44
00:01:26,273 --> 00:01:30,100
So you definitely have either
a maximum or a minimum.

45
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,049
And then to determine which one

46
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,776
you just have to look at the
concavity in one direction.

47
00:01:34,776 --> 00:01:36,520
So you'll look at the
second partial derivative

48
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,268
with respect to x for example,

49
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:40,019
and if that was positive
that would tell you

50
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,322
when you look in the x direction

51
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:43,191
there's a positive
concavity, if it was negative

52
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:45,550
it would mean a negative concavity.

53
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,054
And so that means a positive value

54
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:48,353
for that second partial derivative

55
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:50,505
would mean a local minimum
and a negative value

56
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:52,170
would mean a local maximum.

57
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,339
So that's what it means if this value H

58
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:57,257
turns out to be greater than zero.

59
00:01:57,257 --> 00:02:00,383
And if this value H turns
out to be less than zero,

60
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:02,375
strictly less than zero,
then you definitely

61
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,208
have a saddle point, saddle point.

62
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:08,498
Which is neither a maximum, nor a minimum.

63
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:10,239
It's kind of like there's disagreement

64
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,164
in different directions over whether

65
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:14,389
it should be a maximum or a minimum.

66
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:17,238
And if H equals zero, the
test isn't good enough.

67
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:20,901
You would have to do something
else to figure it out.

68
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:21,962
So why does this work?

69
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:24,237
Why does this seemingly
random conglomeration

70
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:26,882
of second partial
derivatives give you a test

71
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:28,466
that let's you determine what type

72
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,332
of stable point you're looking at?

73
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:32,366
Well let's just understand
each term individually.

74
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:34,932
So this second partial
derivative with respect to x,

75
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:36,760
since you're taking
both partial derivatives

76
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,916
with respect to x,
you're basically treating

77
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,236
the entire multivariable function as if x

78
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:44,369
is the only variable and
y was just some constant.

79
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:45,669
So it's like you're only looking at

80
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,212
movement in the x direction.

81
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:49,362
So in terms of a graph,
let's say we've got like,

82
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:52,088
this graph here, you
can imagine slicing this

83
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,879
with a plane that represents movement

84
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,580
purely in the x direction, so that'll be

85
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,542
a constant y value slice,
and you take a look

86
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:01,473
at the curve where this
slice intersects your graph.

87
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,980
And in the one that I have pictured here

88
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,420
it looks like it's a positive concavity.

89
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,375
So this term right here kind
of tells you x concavity.

90
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,383
So it's kind of like the,
what is the concavity

91
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:15,901
as far as the variable x is concerned.

92
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,734
And then symmetrically, this over here,

93
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,117
when you take the partial derivative

94
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,187
with respect to y two times in a row,

95
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:22,531
it's like you're ignoring the fact

96
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:24,484
that x is even a variable
and you're looking

97
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:27,660
purely at what movement in
the y direction looks like.

98
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,651
Which on the graph that
I have pictured here,

99
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,845
also happens to give you kind of this

100
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,159
positive concavity parabola look,

101
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,073
but the point is that
the curve on the graph

102
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:37,778
that results from looking at movement

103
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:40,378
purely in the y direction can be analyzed

104
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:42,736
just looking at this partial derivative

105
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,488
with respect to y twice in a row.

106
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:48,655
So that term kind of tells
you y concavity, y concavity.

107
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:51,199
Now first of all, notice what happens

108
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,460
if these disagree.

109
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,573
If say, x thought there
should be positive concavity

110
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:56,969
and y thought there should
be negative concavity.

111
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,754
Here, I'll write that
down, what that means.

112
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:00,583
If x thinks there's positive concavity

113
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,291
we have here some kind of positive number

114
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,178
that I'll just write as like,
a plus sign in parenthesis.

115
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,541
And then this here, y concavity, would be

116
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,540
some kind of negative number,
so we'll just put like,

117
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,415
a negative sign in parenthesis.

118
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:12,837
So that would mean this very first term

119
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,707
would be a positive times a negative

120
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:16,656
and that first term would be negative.

121
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,530
And now the thing that
we're subtracting off,

122
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,952
I'll get to the intuition behind this

123
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:22,062
mixed partial derivative term in a moment,

124
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,695
but for now you can notice
that it's something squared,

125
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:27,006
it's something that's
always a positive term.

126
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:28,838
So you're always subtracting
off a positive term

127
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:31,277
which means if this
initial one is negative,

128
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:34,121
the entire term H is
definitely gonna be negative,

129
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,965
so it's gonna put you over into
this saddle point territory.

130
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,672
Which makes sense,
because if the x direction

131
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:40,910
and the y direction disagree on concavity

132
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,409
that should be a saddle point.

133
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:43,713
The quintessential example here

134
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:46,556
is when you have the function f of x, y

135
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:49,973
is equal to x squared minus y squared,

136
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,268
x squared minus y squared.

137
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,451
And the graph of that, by the way,

138
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:56,410
the graph of that would look like this

139
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,374
where, let's see, so
orienting myself here,

140
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:01,204
moving in the x direction
you have kind of,

141
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:03,042
positive concavity which corresponds

142
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:05,484
to the positive coefficient
in front of x squared,

143
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:08,904
and in the y direction it
looks like negative concavity.

144
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:10,858
Corresponding to that negative coefficient

145
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:12,365
in front of the y squared.

146
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:14,561
So when there's disagreement among these,

147
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,194
the test ensures that we're
gonna have a saddle point.

148
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:18,476
Now what about if they agree, right,

149
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:21,123
what if either it's the case that x thinks

150
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:22,549
there should be positive concavity

151
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:24,383
and y thinks there should
be positive concavity,

152
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:27,187
or they both agree that there should be,

153
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:29,095
you know, negative concavity.

154
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,239
In either one of these cases,

155
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,234
when you multiply them
together they're positive.

156
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:34,549
So it's kind of like saying, if you look

157
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:36,992
purely in the x direction or
purely in the y direction,

158
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:39,191
they agree, that there
should be, you know,

159
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,576
definitely positive concavity

160
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:42,041
or definitely negative concavity.

161
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,813
So that entire first term
is going to be positive.

162
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:46,200
So it's kind of like a clever way

163
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,320
of capturing whether
or not the x directions

164
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,028
and y directions agree.

165
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:51,658
However, the reason that it's not enough

166
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:53,365
is 'cause in either case we're still

167
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:57,546
subtracting off something
that's always a positive term.

168
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:59,028
So when you have this agreement

169
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:00,940
between the x dicretion
and the y direction

170
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,852
it then turns into a battle between

171
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:05,541
this x, y agreement
and whatever's going on

172
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,553
with this mixed partial derivative term.

173
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:10,632
And the stronger that mixed
partial derivative term,

174
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:12,668
the bigger this negative number,

175
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:15,146
so the more it's pulling the entire value

176
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:17,183
H towards being negative.

177
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:18,407
So let me see if I can give a little

178
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:20,113
bit of reasoning behind why this

179
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,398
mixed partial derivative term is trying

180
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:25,164
to pull things towards
being a saddle point.

181
00:06:25,164 --> 00:06:27,688
Let's take a look at
the very simple function

182
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,688
f of x, y, is equal to x times y.

183
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:36,434
So what that looks like graphically,

184
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:39,501
f of x, y equal x times y, is this.

185
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,918
It looks like a saddle point.

186
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:46,056
So let's go ahead and look
at it's partial derivatives.

187
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:47,966
So the first partial derivatives,

188
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,266
partial with respect to x and partial

189
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:51,140
with respect to y, well when you do it

190
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,010
with respect to x, x
looks like a variable,

191
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,104
y looks like a constant,
it's just that constant y.

192
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:57,726
And when you do it with respect to y

193
00:06:57,726 --> 00:06:58,866
it goes the other way around.

194
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:01,096
Y looks like the variable,
x looks like the constant

195
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:03,574
so the derivative is that constant x.

196
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:06,298
Now when you take the
second partial derivatives,

197
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:08,373
if you do it with respect
to x twice in a row

198
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:10,485
you're differentiating
this with respect to x,

199
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,725
that looks like a
constant, so you get zero.

200
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:16,256
And similarly, if you
do it with respect to y

201
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:18,735
twice in a row, you're doing this

202
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:21,709
and the derivative of x with respect to y,

203
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,781
x looks like a constant, goes to zero.

204
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,208
But the important term, the one that we're

205
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,161
getting an intuition about here,

206
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:29,801
this mixed partial derivative,
first with respect to x

207
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:32,528
then with respect to y, well
you can view it in two ways.

208
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:35,011
Either you take the
derivative of this expression

209
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:36,759
with respect to y, in which case it's one,

210
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,804
or you think of taking the
derivative of this expression

211
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:42,366
with respect to x, in
which case it's also one.

212
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:46,025
So it's kind of like this
function is a very pure

213
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,731
way to take a look at what this

214
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,372
mixed partial derivative term looks like.

215
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:51,914
And the higher the coefficient here,

216
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:54,964
if I had put a coefficient
of, you know, three here

217
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:56,629
that would mean that the
mixed partial derivative

218
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:59,355
would ultimately end up being three.

219
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:01,633
So notice, the reason that
this looks like a saddle

220
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,952
isn't because the x and
y directions disagree,

221
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:05,940
in fact if you take a
look at pure movement

222
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,850
in the x direction it just
looks like a constant.

223
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,932
The height of the graph along this plane,

224
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:13,335
along this line here is just a constant

225
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:14,716
which corresponds to the fact that the

226
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:16,873
second partial derivative
with respect to x

227
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:18,091
is equal to zero.

228
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:19,966
And then likewise, if
you cut it with a plane

229
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,244
representing a constant x value,

230
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:24,277
meaning movement purely
in the y direction,

231
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:26,838
the height of the graph doesn't
really change along there,

232
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:28,255
it's constantly zero which corresponds

233
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:31,018
to the fact that this other
partial derivative is zero.

234
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:33,528
The reason that the whole
thing looks like a saddle

235
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:36,289
is 'cause when you cut it
with a diagonal plane here,

236
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,421
a diagonal plane, it looks
like it has negative concavity.

237
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:41,455
But if you were to chop it,
you know, in another direction

238
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:45,150
it would look like it
has positive concavity.

239
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,848
So in fact, this xy term
is kind of like a way

240
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:51,006
of capturing whether there's disagreement

241
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:53,608
in the diagonal directions.

242
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:55,278
And one thing that might
be surprising at first

243
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,353
is that you only need one of these

244
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:59,303
second partial derivatives in order

245
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:01,052
to determine all of the information

246
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:02,556
about the diagonal directions.

247
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:03,936
'Cause you can imagine,
you know, maybe there's

248
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:06,739
disagreement between movement
along one certain vector

249
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:08,325
and movement along
another and you would have

250
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:10,414
to account for infinitely many directions

251
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:11,961
and look at all of them.

252
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:14,201
And yet evidently, it's
the case that you only

253
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:16,554
really need to take a look at this

254
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:18,915
mixed partial derivative term.

255
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:20,376
You know, along with the original pure

256
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:22,324
second partial derivatives with respect

257
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:24,559
to x twice and with respect to y twice.

258
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,510
But still, looking at
only three different terms

259
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,624
to take into account possible disagreement

260
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,741
in infinitely many directions actually

261
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:32,569
feels like quite the surprise.

262
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:35,297
And if you want the full,
rigorous justification

263
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,092
for why this is the case, why this

264
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:40,063
second partial derivative test works

265
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:42,015
and kind of, an airtight argument.

266
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,792
I've put that in an
article that you can find

267
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,826
that kind of, goes into the dirty details

268
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,290
for those who are interested.

269
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,633
But if you just want the intuition,

270
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:49,890
I think it's fine to think about

271
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,722
the fact that this
mixed partial derivative

272
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:54,082
is telling you how much your function

273
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:58,395
looks like the graph of f
of x, y equal x times y.

274
00:09:58,395 --> 00:09:59,732
Which is the graph that kind of captures

275
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,699
all of the diagonal disagreement.

276
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:03,916
And then when you let that term,

277
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,378
that mixed partial derivative term,

278
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:07,131
kind of compete with the agreement

279
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:08,836
between the x and y directions,

280
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:10,830
you know, if they agree very strongly,

281
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,664
you have to subtract
off a very strong amount

282
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:14,531
in order to pull it
back to being negative.

283
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,132
So this battle back and
forth, if it's pulled

284
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:19,328
to be very negative that
will give you a saddle point,

285
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,320
if it doesn't pull hard
enough, then the agreement

286
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,918
between the x and y directions wins out

287
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:26,760
and it's either a local
maximum or a local minimum.

288
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,891
So hopefully that sheds
a little bit of light

289
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:32,695
on why this term makes sense
and why it's a reasonable way

290
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:35,788
to combine the three different
second partial derivatives

291
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:37,858
available to you, and
again, if you want the full

292
00:10:37,858 --> 00:10:41,226
details, I've written that
up in an article form.

293
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:42,724
I'll see you next video.
