1
00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:02,282
- [Voiceover] So I've said that
if you have a vector field,

2
00:00:02,282 --> 00:00:03,559
a two-dimensional vector field

3
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:05,741
with component functions P and Q,

4
00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:09,793
that the divergence of this
guy, the divergence of v,

5
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:13,300
which is a scalar-valued
function of x and y,

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,957
is by definition, the
partial derivative of P,

7
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:20,696
with respect to x, plus the
partial derivative of Q,

8
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:22,320
with respect to y.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,282
And there's actually another
notation for divergence

10
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:26,308
that's kind of helpful for
remembering the formula.

11
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:29,159
And what it is, is you
take this nabla symbol,

12
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,794
that upside down triangle that
we also use for the gradient,

13
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,720
and imagine taking the
dot product between that

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,487
and your vector-valued function.

15
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:38,134
And as we did with the gradient,

16
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:41,285
the loose mnemonic you have
for this upside down triangle,

17
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:42,951
as you think of it as a vector,

18
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:45,053
full of partial differential operators,

19
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,014
and that sounds fancy but all it means

20
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,453
is you kind of take
this partial, partial x,

21
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:51,241
a thing that wants to take in a function

22
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:52,706
and take its partial derivative,

23
00:00:52,706 --> 00:00:54,295
and that's its first component,

24
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:57,591
and the second component
is this partial, partial y,

25
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,356
a thing that wants to take in a function

26
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:01,736
and take its partial
derivative with respect to y.

27
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:03,718
And, you know, loosely
this isn't really a vector,

28
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:06,276
these aren't numbers, or
functions, or things like that,

29
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:07,695
but it's something you can write down

30
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:10,014
and it'll be kind of helpful symbolically.

31
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:12,557
And you imagine taking
the dot product with that,

32
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:15,673
and, you know, v who has components,

33
00:01:15,673 --> 00:01:19,840
these scalar-valued functions,
P of xy, and Q of xy.

34
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:24,622
And when you imagine
doing this dot product,

35
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:25,861
and you're kind of lining up terms

36
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:27,728
and the first one multiplied
by the second, right,

37
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:30,198
quote unquote multiplied,
because, in this case,

38
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:32,464
when I say this first
component multiplied by p,

39
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:35,148
I really mean you're taking
that partial derivative operator

40
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:39,070
partial, partial x,
and evaluating it at p.

41
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,577
That's kind of what multiplication
looks like in this case.

42
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:44,537
So, you take that, and as per
the dot product you then add,

43
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,693
what happens if you take
this partial operator,

44
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:49,939
this partial, partial
y, and quote unquote,

45
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:51,250
multiply it with q.

46
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,436
Which, in the case of an operator,

47
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:54,200
means you kind of give it the function q

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,213
and it's gonna take
its partial derivative.

49
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:58,199
So, we see we get the
same thing over here,

50
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:00,429
it's the same formula that we have,

51
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:02,786
and it's just kind of a nice, little,

52
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:04,545
you can think of it as a mnemonic device

53
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:07,736
for remembering what the divergence is.

54
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:11,819
But another nice thing, this can apply

55
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,809
to higher-dimensional functions, as well.

56
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:18,260
Right? If we have
something that, let's see,

57
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,880
something that's a vector-valued function,

58
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,867
and it's gonna be a
three-dimensional vector field.

59
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,271
So, it's got x, y, and z as its inputs,

60
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:27,027
and its output then also has
to have three dimensions.

61
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:30,474
So, it might be like, P, Q, and R,

62
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,682
and all of these are functions of x and y.

63
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:36,698
So, that's P of x and y, Q,
oh no, x, y, and z, right?

64
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,708
So, P of x, y, kind of got in the habit

65
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:43,875
of two dimensions there, P of
x, y and z, Q of x, y, and z,

66
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:49,120
and then R of x, y, and z.

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,498
And I haven't talked about
three-dimensional divergence.

68
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:52,581
But if you think of this

69
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:55,929
and then you imagine
doing your nabla, dotted

70
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:58,971
with the vector-valued function,
it can still make sense.

71
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,654
And in this case, that
nabla you're thinking of

72
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:04,002
as having three different components.

73
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:07,878
It's gonna be, on the one
hand this partial, partial x,

74
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:11,143
I should say partial x there, partial x,

75
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:14,799
now the second component
is partial, partial y,

76
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:16,790
and the last component
is partial, partial z.

77
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,342
And the ordering of
these, of the variables,

78
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:21,741
here, x, y and z is just
whatever I have here.

79
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:23,981
So, even if they didn't
have the names x, y, z,

80
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:24,994
you kinda out them in the same order

81
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:27,059
that they show up in your function.

82
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:30,055
And when you imagine taking
the dot product between this,

83
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:32,964
and your P as a function, Q as a function,

84
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:36,464
and R as a function, vector-valued output,

85
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,729
what you get, and I'll write it over here,

86
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,076
you take that partial, partial
x and kind of multiply it,

87
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:49,757
with P, which means you're
really evaluating at P.

88
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:51,840
So, partial x here.

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,319
Then you add partial, partial y.

90
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,977
And you're evaluating at Q,
because you're kind of imagining

91
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:59,592
multiplying these second components.

92
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:00,660
And you'll add what happens

93
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,479
when you multiply by
these third components,

94
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,646
or that's partial, partial
z, by that last component.

95
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,990
And, you know, since I haven't talked

96
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,321
about three-dimensional vector fields,

97
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:15,046
with three-dimensional
divergence, this last term,

98
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,308
maybe it's not given that you'd
have as strong an intuition

99
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:19,690
for why this shows up in
divergence as the other two,

100
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,803
but it's actually quite similar,

101
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,561
you're thinking about changes
to the z component of a vector

102
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:25,661
as the value z, of the input,

103
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,643
as you're kind of moving up

104
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:29,242
and down and that direction changes.

105
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:31,652
But this pattern will go
for even higher dimensions

106
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:34,694
that we can't visualize, four,
five, 100, whatever you want.

107
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:37,100
And that's what makes this
notation here quite nice,

108
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,643
is that it encapsulates that

109
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:40,825
and gives a really compact way

110
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:43,015
of describing this formula that,

111
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:44,184
it has a simple pattern to it,

112
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:47,137
but would otherwise kind of
get out of hand to write.

113
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:47,970
See you next video.
